TI Surface water changes in China's Yangtze River Delta over the past forty
   years
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB Surface water security is a challenge in highly urbanized, economically active, and high water consumption regions. Exploring the supply and demand of surface water resources in developed is conducive to promoting the sustainable socioeconomic development of these agglomerations. The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region is one of the most important world-class urban in China. However, it is unclear how surface water has responded to underlying impacts of climate change and anthropogenic water exploitation over the past decades. Here, we monitored the spatiotemporal characteristics of surface water and investigated the driving forces and regional impact of surface water changes. We found that (1) the trend in surface water body area in China's YRD was stable over the past 40 years; (2) precipitation and the digital elevation model best determined the spatial dis-tribution of surface water in the YRD; (3) the construction of reservoirs was the main factor for the increase of surface water area; and (4) the increase in population density was the main driver of the decrease in surface water area. Human activities deplete and artificially increase surface water supply, which tends to offset; human activities have decreased water conservation services and soil and water conservation services of the YRD.

TI Climatic changes in the Late Campanian-Early Maastrichtian:
   Micropaleontological and stable isotopic evidence from an epicontinental
   sea
SO JOURNAL OF FORAMINIFERAL RESEARCH
AB Benthic foraminiferal and calcareous nannofossil assemblages, as well as stable isotope data from the Campanian/Maastrichtian boundary interval (similar to 71.4 to similar to 70.7 Ma) of the Kronsmoor section (North German Basin), were investigated in order to characterize changes in surface-water productivity and oxygen content at the seafloor and their link to climatic and paleoceanographic changes. A nutrient index based on calcareous nannofossils is derived for the high-latitude, epicontinental North German Basin, reflecting changes in surface-water productivity. Oxygen isotopes of well-preserved planktic foraminiferal specimens of Heterohelix globulosa reflect warmer surface-water temperatures in the lower part of the studied succession and a cooling of up to 2 degrees C (0.5%) in the upper part (after 71.1 Ma). For the lower and warmer part of the investigated succession, benthic foraminiferal assemblages and the calcareous nannofossils indicate well-oxygenated bottom waters and low-surface water productivity. In contrast, the upper part of the succession is characterized by cooler conditions, lower oxygen content at the seafloor and increasing surface-water productivity. It is proposed that the cooling phase starting at 71.1 Ma was accompanied by increasing surface-water mixing caused by westerly winds. As a consequence of mixing, nutrients were advected from subsurface waters into the mixed layer, resulting in increased surface-water productivity and enhanced organic matter flux to the seafloor. We hypothesize that global sea-level fall during the earliest Maastrichtian (similar to 71.3 Ma), indicated by decreasing carbon isotope values, may have led to a weaker water mass exchange through narrower gateways between the Boreal Realm and the open North Atlantic and Tethys oceans. Both the weaker water mass exchange and enhanced surface-water productivity may have led to slightly less ventilated bottom waters of the upper part of the studied section. Our micropaleontological and stable isotopic approach indicates short-term (<100 kyr) changes in oxygen consumption at the seafloor and surface-water productivity across the homogeneous Boreal White Chalk succession of the North German Basin.

TI Assessment of climate change impacts on the quantity and quality of a
   coastal catchment using a coupled groundwater-surface water model
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB The hydrology of coastal catchments is influenced by both sea level and climate. Hence, a comprehensive assessment of the impact of climate change on coastal catchments is a challenging task. In the present study, a coupled groundwater-surface water model is forced by dynamically downscaled results from a general circulation model. The effects on water quantity and quality of a relatively large lake used for water supply are analyzed. Although stream inflow to the lake is predicted to decrease during summer, the storage capacity of the lake is found to provide a sufficient buffer to support sustainable water abstraction in the future. On the other hand, seawater intrusion into the stream is found to be a significant threat to the water quality of the lake, possibly limiting its use for water supply and impacting the aquatic environment. Additionally, the results indicate that the nutrient load to the lake and adjacent coastal waters is likely to increase significantly, which will increase eutrophication and have negative effects on the surface water ecology. The hydrological impact assessment is based on only one climate change projection; nevertheless, the range of changes generated by other climate models indicates that the predicted results are a plausible realization of climate change impacts. The problems identified here are expected to be relevant for many coastal regimes, where the hydrology is determined by the interaction between saline and fresh groundwater and surface water systems.

TI Influence of Urban Areas on Surface Water Loss in the Contiguous United
   States
SO AGU ADVANCES
AB Urbanization is one of the main drivers of surface water loss, which implies a transition from water to land. However, it is still unclear how urban areas affect the spatial pattern of surface water loss. Here, we use remotely sensed data to analyze and model the decrease of surface water extent and, in particular, the frequency of surface water loss as a function of distance from urban areas across the contiguous United States (CONUS). We employ an exponential distance-decay model that confirms the presence of a higher frequency of surface water loss in the proximity of human settlements and provides innovative insights on surface water loss patterns at different spatial scales (i.e., river basins, water resource regions, and the CONUS). These spatial patterns are found to be influenced by climatic conditions, with more widely distributed losses in arid regions with respect to temperate and continental climates. Our results provide a new and deeper understanding of the spatial influence of urban areas on surface water loss, which could be effectively integrated in the definition of sustainable strategies for urbanization, water management, and surface water restoration, focused on both human and environmental water needs.

TI Impact of changing climate and land use on the hydrogeology of southeast
   Australia
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
AB Anthropogenic climate change is the Earth's most serious large-scale environmental concern. While the projected changes of global temperatures, rainfall and surface water have been modelled in a sophisticated manner, the impact on groundwater resources is much less well constrained. In southeast Australia, the decrease in rainfall amount and an increase in temperature that are predicted by climate models are generally assumed to reduce the amount of recharge to the groundwater systems. However, the increase in recharge that has resulted from clearing of the native vegetation will almost certainly produce a greater impact on the groundwater system, increasing quantity and potentially improving quality. Additionally, the impact on recharge of changes to rainfall frequency rather than just total amount is not well documented. Overall our understanding of the impacts of climate change on groundwater systems is insufficiently advanced to make firm predictions. Indirect impacts of climate change, particularly the projected increased demand for groundwater or surface water to supplement surface water supplies also will have a major impact that may be greater than the direct effect of climate change.

TI The spatio-temporal variations of surface water quality in China during
   the "Eleventh Five-Year Plan"
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB Surface water pollution has become a hot issue in recent years in that deterioration of surface water quality has hampered the sustainable development of China's economy. Previous studies have analyzed regional changes of water pollutants, but very few have studied at a national scale. By analyzing 9 water quality parameters recorded at 422 sampling stations nationwide, this studies summarized the spatial and temporal variations of surface water quality in China in "11th Five-Year Plan" period. Research showed that China's surface water quality is improving. But, further deterioration in several areas cannot be ignored. Human activities including over-urbanization and farming exerted a negative impact on surface water quality. Though the water quality in the upstream of major rivers located in northwest China was relatively better than that of other areas, deterioration of surface water quality has begun to emerge in the area. Additionally, the surface water quality in southern China was better than that of northern China. But some studies indicated that surface water quality was likely to worsen at a high speed. It was also found that different water quality parameters are characterized by spatial and temporal variations. These studies pointed out, the government should pay more attention to in the areas where the water quality parameters significantly exceeded the national standards. These studies provides theoretical basis for the decision-making and implementation of macro-scale water quality control policies.

TI Contiguous US surface water availability and short-term trends of
   wastewater effluent flows in San Antonio, TX
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Surface water is a vital and sometimes stressed resource in the U.S. The quantity of this resource is threatened by population shifts and growth concurrently with climate change intensification. Additionally, growing population centers can impact water quality by discharging treated wastewater effluent, which is typically of lower quality than its receiving surface waters. Depending on baseflow and environmental factors, this could decrease water quality. From a previous model prepared in our lab, this study can improve the understanding of water resource quality and quantity, surface water availability for the contiguous U.S. was estimated for each USGS Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) during 2015. The Mississippi River generally served as a dividing line for surface water availability, with five of the six regions with very low water availability (<24,000 LD(-1)Km(-2)) residing in the west. These same areas also experience more drought as well as more severe droughts than regions in the east. In regions with lower surface water flows, their water quality is more susceptible to the influence of wastewater effluent discharges, especially near large and growing population centers like San Antonio, Texas. A prediction model was established for this city, which found that from 2009 to 2017 wastewater effluent increased by 1.8%. As cities grow, especially in the Southwest and Western U.S. together with intensified climate change, surface water quantity and quality become more crucial to sustainability. This study shows where surface water availability is already an issue and provides a model to estimate, as well as project, wastewater effluent flows into surface water bodies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Groundwater and Surface Water Interactions in Relation to Natural and
   Anthropogenic Environmental Changes
SO EMERGING ISSUES IN GROUNDWATER RESOURCES
SE Advances in Water Security
AB Groundwater and surface water interaction is an essential component of the hydrological cycle. The hydraulic connectivity and exchange of water between surface water (e.g. rivers, lakes, wetlands) and underlying aquifers provide many ecosystem services that sustain human and ecological well-being. Climate change, increased population, and industrial growth have resulted in substantial environmental (e.g. land use and land cover, climate, groundwater) changes across the globe. As a result, decline in groundwater levels, drying of streams, shrinking lakes, wetlands, and estuaries have been observed across the world. This generates concerns about the effects of such environmental changes on groundwater and surface water interactions, and on the quality and quantity of water resources. This chapter presents an overview of groundwater and surface water interactions, pressing environmental change issues centered on natural and anthropogenic environmental changes, and available management tools that quantify the integrated groundwater and surface water flow processes. This chapter also briefly discusses exciting research opportunities enabled by satellite remote sensing. We close in with a discussion of future management challenges and strategies for sustainable use of groundwater and surface water resources. One outcome of this chapter is to provide resource managers, researchers, consultant groups, and government agencies basic understanding of the types, mechanism, and effects of natural and anthropogenic landuse changes on groundwater and surface water interactions, and available management tools for studying groundwater and surface water interactions.

AB Characteristics of the Mississippi catchment surface water and energy budgets in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) regional spectral model (RSM) and the driving NCEP/NCAR global reanalysis (NCEPR) are compared. The RSM is similar to the Global Spectral Model (GSM) used in the reanalyses, in that it was originally derived from the global model. However, the RSM does not have an artificial water source to maintain the surface moisture (unlike the NCEPR) and the RSM surface water dries. Although the much larger wintertime surface water difference has only a small effect on the evaporation differences and other components of the wintertime water and energy cycles, summertime effects are greater. The RSM develops consistent summertime hydroclimatological differences of decreased surface water, precipitation, evaporation, increased sensible heating, outgoing longwave radiation, incoming solar radiation and temperature. The RSM Mississippi River basin also has larger interannual surface water (and other water and energy) variations than might be discerned from the NCEPB. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Review: The projected hydrologic cycle under the scenario of 936ppm CO2
   in 2100
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB A host of environmental consequences will result from global warming, but arguably, the effect on water resources is one of the most consequential. This paper synthesizes results of published modeling studies that examined the groundwater system and hydrologic cycle under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario (CO2 at 936-ppm level at year 2100). Natural replenishment of groundwater occurs predominantly from infiltration of precipitation and surface impoundments. Therefore, the first stage of the study was to review a changed hydrologic cycle under RCP 8.5 in terms of influence from (1) precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture; (2) surface water and its interaction with groundwater; (3) extreme hydrologic events, and (4) teleconnection patterns. The general pattern of climate impact on groundwater resources follows the precipitation pattern with depletion in tropical and/or subtropical regions and with increase in the high-latitude regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. However, regional variability also corresponds to the heterogenous impact of climate changes on regional distribution of precipitation and evapotranspiration, localized interaction between surface water and groundwater, and distances from the oceans with rising sea level. The decline of the water table in many areas may seriously reduce irrigated crop production and adversely impact groundwater-dependent ecosystems. Relatively fewer studies have been conducted on climate-change impacts on groundwater resources compared to surface-water systems, and the uncertainties on the recharge estimates are large. There appears to be an urgent need for including groundwater systems in climate impact assessment and in climate mitigation strategies.

TI A review of nanotechnological applications to detect and control surface
   water pollution
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
AB Surface water is extremely susceptible to pollution stemming from human activities, such as the expansion of urban and suburban areas, industries, cities, and agriculture. In fact, sources of surface water have become the most common discharge sites for wastewater, which may contain microorganisms, pharmaceutical waste, heavy metals, and harmful pollutants. As a reference standard for clean water, the water quality standards and index of Malaysia were used. In comparison with conventional wastewater treatment methods, new nanomaterial-based methods for water filtration and purification are drawing attention as more efficient methods for water pollution detection and treatment. This prompts the use of nanotechnology applications to control surface water pollution and quality, as surface water is the main source of water consumption for humans, animals, and plants. This paper reviewed the application of nanotechnology for the detection and treatment of surface water pollution to ensure the sustainability of a green environment. This paper also highlighted the application of nanotechnology, namely, nanofiltration membranes, photocatalysis, plasma discharge, and nano-adsorbents, in wastewater treatment, as well as the application of nano-sensors for monitoring surface water quality. The integration of nano-adsorbents in the conventional technology may increase treatment efficiency because nano-adsorbents have demonstrated remarkable performance in the removal of contaminants in wastewater. The hurdles, challenges, and outlook of nanotechnology for wastewater treatment were addressed in this review. The insights presented in this paper may provide opportunities and directions to expand studies pertaining to the applications of nanotechnology for future surface water treatment.

AB The global distribution of the radioactive isotope iodine-129 in surface waters (lakes and rivers) is presented here and compared with the atmospheric deposition and distribution in surface marine waters. The results indicate relatively high concentrations in surface water systems in close vicinity of the anthropogenic release sources as well as in parts of Western Europe, North America and Central Asia. I-129 level is generally higher in the terrestrial surface water of the Northern hemisphere compared to the southern hemisphere. The highest values of I-129 appear around 50 degrees N and 40 degrees S in the northern and southern hemisphere, separately. Direct gaseous and marine atmospheric emissions are the most likely avenues for the transport of 1291 from the sources to the terrestrial surface waters. To apply iodine-129 as process tracer in terrestrial surface water environment, more data are needed on I-129 distribution patterns both locally and globally. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI Long-Term Changes of Open-Surface Water Bodies in the Yangtze River
   Basin Based on the Google Earth Engine Cloud Platform
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB The spatiotemporal changes of open-surface water bodies in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) have profound influences on sustainable economic development, and are also closely relevant to water scarcity in China. However, long-term changes of open-surface water bodies in the YRB have remained poorly characterized. Taking advantage of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform, this study processed 75,593 scenes of Landsat images to investigate the long-term changes of open-surface water bodies in the YRB from 1984 to 2018. In this study, we adopted the percentile-based image composite method to collect training samples and proposed a multiple index water detection rule (MIWDR) to quickly extract the open-surface water bodies. The results indicated that (1) the MIWDR is suitable for the long-term and large-scale Landsat water bodies mapping, especially in the urban regions. (2) The areas of permanent water bodies and seasonal water bodies were 29,076.70 km(2) and 21,526.24 km(2), accounting for 57.46% and 42.54% of the total open-surface water bodies in the YRB, respectively. (3) The permanent water bodies in the YRB increased along with the decreases in the seasonal water bodies from 1984 to 2018. In general, the total open-surface surface water bodies in the YRB experienced an increasing trend, with an obvious spatial heterogeneity. (4) The changes of open-surface water bodies were associated with the climate changes and intense human activities in the YRB, however, the influences varied among different regions and need to be further investigated in the future.

TI Modeling groundwater and surface water interaction: An overview of
   current status and future challenges
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The interaction between surface water and groundwater constitutes a critical process to understand the quantitative and qualitative regime of dependent hydrosystems. A multi-scale approach combining cross-disciplinary techniques can considerably reduce uncertainties and provide an optimal understanding of groundwater and surface water exchanges. The simulation process constitutes the most effective tool for such analysis; however, its implementation requires a variety of data, a detailed analysis of the hydrosystem, and time to finalize a reliable solution. The results of the simulation process contribute to the raising of awareness for water protection and the application of better management strategies. Knowledge of models' parameters has great importance to ensure reliable results in the modeling process. In this study, a literature overview of modeling applications in groundwater - surface water interaction is provided. In this context, a comprehensive and holistic approach to groundwater and surface water simulation codes is here presented; results, case studies, and future challenges are also discussed. The main finding of the analysis highlights uncertainties and gaps in the modeling process due to the lack of high frequency and depth dependent field measurements. In many studies, authors underestimate the importance of the hydrogeological regime, and the discretization of hydraulic parameters is often lumped in a simplified manner. The modeling ethics in terms of data transparency and openness should be widely considered to improve the modeling results. The current study contributes to overcome common weaknesses of model applications, fulfils gaps in the existing literature, and highlights the importance of the modeling process in planning sustainable management of water resources.

TI Optimization and transformation of water treatment technology for
   surface water reinjection into geothermal reservoir in Dongli Lake area

AB Tianjin is one of the areas with higher geothermal resources development and utilization in China. In 2013, the first surface water reinjection test base in China was established in Dongli Lake area. However, some problems had occurred during the operation of surface water reinjection, which affected the effect of surface water reinjection. Aiming at the problems during operation, we optimized and transformed the water treatment process of surface water reinjection, so that the reinjection system could operate stably. This will supply the thermal reservoir effectively and alleviate the decline of thermal reservoir pressure, and then geothermal resources will be developed and utilized sustainably. After the transformation and upgrading of surface water treatment process, the maximum reinjection volume was 150 m(3)/h, it could increase the production of geothermal resources to 200000 m(3)/a, and increased the heating area of geothermal to 150000 m(2)/a. The surface water treatment process will reduce the emission of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, coal ash and other pollutants, saving 879100 yuan of environmental treatment fee (environmental protection tax) and 2.6 million yuan of resource tax every year. And the calculated operation cost was about 1.80 similar to 2.26 yuan/m(3). It will play an exemplary role in the stable operation of surface water reinjection, provide new ideas for surface water reinjection and the protection of geothermal resources, and provide technical support for the realization of the double carbon goal.

TI Contribution of environmental media to cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis
   prevalence in Tehran: a focus on surface waters
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The occurrences of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in surface sources of drinking water in Tehran were monitored, using US EPA method 1623.1. The prevalence ratios (PR) of positive samples among other media (animal's stools, vegetables, and human's stools) were also estimated from literature data. The density of Giardia and Cryptosporidium in water samples were 0.129 +/- A 0.069 cysts/L and 0.005 +/- A 0.002 oocysts/L, respectively. Estimated PR in vegetables, animal stools, surface waters, and human stools were 6.65, 20.42, 21.05, and 4.28 % for Cryptosporidium and 6.46, 17.13, 73.68, and 15.65 % for Giardia, respectively. These reveal the importance of surface waters' and animal stools' roles in the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis in Tehran's population. Giardia's prevalence in untreated surface waters in Tehran was found 3.5 times as much as Cryptosporidium while this found 2.3 times on a global scale. Moreover, the prevalence of giardiasis to cryptosporidiosis infections in Tehran's human population was 3.65. These values could be a clue to attribute the infections to the occurrence of parasites in surface waters. Significant (p < 0.05) associations were observed between rainfalls and presence of Giardia (r = 0.62) and Cryptosporidium (r = 0.60) in surface waters. In autumn, rainfalls can increase the parasites occurrences in surface waters. Significant (p < 0.05) difference on the density of parasites was found between some seasons using Kruskal-Wallis and multiple comparison tests. A significant correlation (r = 0.86) between Giardia and Cryptosporidium densities also confirms the common sources of pollution in surface waters. Findings suggest that untreated surface waters in Tehran may be a potential route of human exposure to protozoan parasites.

TI Observing Global Surface Water Flood Dynamics
SO SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
AB Flood waves moving along river systems are both a key determinant of globally important biogeochemical and ecological processes and, at particular times and particular places, a major environmental hazard. In developed countries, sophisticated observing networks and ancillary data, such as channel bathymetry and floodplain terrain, exist with which to understand and model floods. However, at global scales, satellite data currently provide the only means of undertaking such studies. At present, there is no satellite mission dedicated to observing surface water dynamics and, therefore, surface water scientists make use of a range of sensors developed for other purposes that are distinctly sub-optimal for the task in hand. Nevertheless, by careful combination of the data available from topographic mapping, oceanographic, cryospheric and geodetic satellites, progress in understanding some of the world's major river, floodplain and wetland systems can be made. This paper reviews the surface water data sets available to hydrologists on a global scale and the recent progress made in the field. Further, the paper looks forward to the proposed NASA/CNES Surface Water Ocean Topography satellite mission that may for the first time provide an instrument that meets the needs of the hydrology community.

TI Remediation of polluted surface water outfalls - customer communication
   and changes in behaviour
SO WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL
AB Water and sewerage companies are experiencing increased levels of pollution at surface water outfalls attributable to incorrectly installed wastewater pipe work from predominantly domestic premises. Foul to surface water plumbing errors can cause environmental pollution in local rivers and streams, but the remediation of polluted surface water outfalls is sustainable only if undertaken in parallel with stakeholder education. Methodologies developed to date to inform, educate or change customer behaviour regarding misconnections have done little to reduce the problem. This paper reports on a study conducted to identify gaps in customers' knowledge with a view to raising awareness of the issues. It is anticipated that the conclusions drawn will be used to better inform the public about misconnections through effectively targeted communications.

TI Spatiotemporal assessment and pollution-source identification and
   quantification of the surface water system in a coastal region of
   Vietnam
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL
AB Surface water quality in coastal regions may be degraded due to various pollution sources, including seawater intrusion, dependent on season and distance from the coastline. This study aimed to fractionate and quantify pollution sources affecting surface water quality in a coastal region of Vietnam. Between 2016 and 2020, 400 surface water samples were collected from 40 sites during dry and rainy seasons and analysed for 15 parameters. The results showed that four primary pollution sources - seawater intrusion, agricultural production, residential activities, and human activities impacting the hydrological system - may contribute to the degradation of water quality. Seawater intrusion contributed approximately 83.3% to the determination of water quality in dry seasons and 35.3% in rainy seasons. Water quality was more degraded in areas within 20 km of the coastline than in more distant areas. A management strategy should be developed and implemented to improve surface water quality for sustainable development.

TI Legal Status of Surface Waters-Comparative Study on the Example of Lakes
SO WATER
AB Water laws in post-Soviet countries have developed in vastly different ways since each state became entitled to choose its own method of regulating inland water ownership. This article analyzes the Russian Federation and selected post-Soviet states' legal systems related to ownership of surface waters, and assesses the possibility of legal transactions of lakes and other land areas covered by surface water. The research initially centers on establishing whether lakes are owned by the state or by the county, if a lake can be subject to sale to a private person or enterprise and finally examines the different approaches of post-Soviet countries to their surface water use. In achieving these objectives, the article analyzes water law in the Russian Federation, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. It then identifies how water ownership is regulated in these countries and compares this with United Nations assumptions of surface water ownership as a Sustainable Development Goal. Finally, the results establish that countries from the same "block" regulate water ownership similarly, and that combined regulations could enhance future implementation of international standards.

TI Identifying Key Influences on Surface Water Quality in Freshwater Areas
   of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta from 2018 to 2020
SO WATER
AB Urbanization, industrialization, and the loss of freshwater resources are leading to an increased awareness of the importance of surface water quality worldwide. Limited ground water resources, prolonged drouths, and flooding are creating pressure on the availability of freshwater sources in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. However, the surface water quality in this region is measured mainly at the provincial level, without reference to the water quality of adjacent regions. In order to identify and understand the key factors that contribute significantly to the quality of surface water, it is necessary to consider the delta region as a holistic system and to systematically investigate the influence of different land uses on water quality. In this study, surface water quality was evaluated during the dry season, when flow is low and water exchange is limited. For this purpose, the temporal variation in the surface water quality of 12 water quality parameters at 132 monitoring stations was analyzed according to their surrounding type of land use. To further investigate the impact on low-hierarchy canals, a correlation analysis between the river and canal class hierarchy and all investigated water quality parameters was performed. The results show that surface water quality suffers particularly in the case of a low dissolved oxygen (DO) content, with a measured minimum of 0.48 mg/L, and in cases of organic pollution in the form of total suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand, and chemical oxygen demand, with values up to 146 mg/L, 75.0 mg/L, and 41.0 mg/L, respectively. As the main factors influencing surface water pollution, freshwater aquaculture and industrial activities were identified. This could have a relevant impact on future sustainable land use planning.

TI Influence of Surface Water on Desert Vegetation Expansion at the
   Landscape Scale: A Case Study of the Daliyabuyi Oasis, Taklamakan Desert
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Surface water is an important factor affecting vegetation change in desert areas. However, little research has been conducted on the effects of surface water on vegetation expansion. In this study, the annual spatial distribution range of vegetation and surface water in the Daliyabuyi Oasis from 1990 to 2020 was extracted using Landsat time-series images. Based on multi-temporal and multi-scale remote sensing images, several plots were selected to demonstrate the process of landform change and vegetation expansion, and the influence of surface water on vegetation expansion was analyzed. The results show that the vegetation distribution and surface water coverage have increased from 1990 to 2020; and surface water is a critical factor that drives the expansion of vegetation. On the one hand, surface water in the study area was essential for reshaping the riparian landform, driving the transformation of dunes into floodplains, and increasing the potential colonization sites for vegetation. However, landform changes ultimately changed the redistribution of surface water, ensuring that enough water and nutrients provided by sediment were available for plant growth. Our study provides a critical reference for the restoration of desert vegetation and the sustainable development of oases.

TI Managing surface water contamination in Nagoya, Japan: An integrated
   water basin management decision framework
SO WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB The water quality of rivers in Japan has received greater attention in recent years due to a number of factors, including human-induced land subsidence and an increase in water demand. Surface waters are adversely affected by high frequency, low level risks (such as the continuous release of hazardous substances) and less frequent, high impact risks (such as the release of chemicals due to natural disasters or industrial accidents). This paper puts forth an integrated Water Basin Management (WBM) decision framework to study the latter: these relatively infrequent, but often catastrophic hazards, are less well-studied than the more familiar high frequency, low level risks. The six main components of this WBM decision framework involve (a) determining possible threats to surface waters; (b) identifying surface waters most at risk to contamination; (c) identifying weaknesses (gaps) in current monitoring systems; (d) using accident analysis to determine proactive WBM; (e) analyzing the temporal-spatial impact of policies on water basins, (f) designing new policies and approaches for integrated WBM. Japan's recently published Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR) is used to develop a WBM decision framework for managing surface water contamination in Nagoya, Japan. Participatory surface water management is emphasized in order to achieve a holistic and sustainable WBM decision making process.

TI Quantification of surface water volume changes in the Mackenzie Delta
   using satellite multi-mission data
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB Quantification of surface water storage in extensive floodplains and their dynamics are crucial for a better understanding of global hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. In this study, we present estimates of both surface water extent and storage combining multi-mission remotely sensed observations and their temporal evolution over more than 15 years in the Mackenzie Delta. The Mackenzie Delta is located in the northwest of Canada and is the second largest delta in the Arctic Ocean. The delta is frozen from October to May and the recurrent ice break-up provokes an increase in the river's flows. Thus, this phenomenon causes intensive floods along the delta every year, with dramatic environmental impacts. In this study, the dynamics of surface water extent and volume are analysed from 2000 to 2015 by combining multi-satellite information from MODIS multispectral images at 500 m spatial resolution and river stages derived from ERS-2 (1995-2003), ENVISAT (2002-2010) and SARAL (since 2013) altimetry data. The surface water extent (permanent water and flooded area) peaked in June with an area of 9600 km(2) (+/- 200 km(2)) on average, representing approximately 70% of the delta's total surface. Altimetry-based water levels exhibit annual amplitudes ranging from 4 m in the downstream part to more than 10 m in the upstream part of the Mackenzie Delta. A high overall correlation between the satellite-derived and in situ water heights (R > 0.84) is found for the three altimetry missions. Finally, using altimetry-based water levels and MODIS-derived surface water extents, maps of interpolated water heights over the surface water extents are produced. Results indicate a high variability of the water height magnitude that can reach 10 m compared to the lowest water height in the upstream part of the delta during the flood peak in June. Furthermore, the total surface water volume is estimated and shows an annual variation of approximately 8.5 km(3) during the whole study period, with a maximum of 14.4 km(3) observed in 2006. The good agreement between the total surface water volume retrievals and in situ river discharges (R = 0.66) allows for validation of this innovative multi-mission approach and highlights the high potential to study the surface water extent dynamics.

TI Comparing cost-effectiveness of surface water flood management
   interventions in a UK catchment
SO JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
AB Despite significant consequences caused by recent events, surface water flooding has historically been of lower priority relative to fluvial and coastal risks in UK flood management. Legislation and research proposes a variety of innovative interventions to address this; however, widespread application of these remains a challenge due to a number of institutional, economic, and technical barriers. This research applies a framework capable of fast and high-resolution assessment of intervention cost-effectiveness as an opportunity to improve available evidence and encourage uptake of interventions through analysing permutations of type, scale, and distribution in urban catchments. Fast assessment of many scenarios is achieved using a cellular automata flood model and a simplified representation of interventions. Conventional and green strategies are examined across a range of design standard and high-magnitude rainfall events in an urban catchment. Results indicate high-volume rainwater capture interventions demonstrate a significant reduction in estimated annual damage costs, and localised surface water drainage interventions exhibit high cost-effectiveness for damage reduction. Analysis of performance across a wide range of return periods enhances available evidence for option comparison decision support and provides a basis for future resilience assessment of interventions.

TI Surface water estimation at regional scale using hybrid techniques in
   GEE environment-A case study on Punjab State of India
SO REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Monitoring surface water bodies accurately is one of the most crucial applications of remote sensing. It is a global challenge in the times of climate change, since surface water is the most important component of the hydrological cycle. Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) method based on spectral index is calculated from the Green and Shortwave-Infrared (SWIR) bands, for monitoring surface water. This index helps to map surface water accurately based on the threshold using Otsu method for achieving higher level of accuracy. Earth observing satellite by ESA, Sentinel-2 provides multispectral images at a fine spatial and spectral resolution. This dataset has high potentiality for significantly mapping regional surface water, due to its frequent revisiting capabilities and spectral capabilities. Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform can be used for processing the huge datasets easily in the most efficient way for fast computation, storing and displaying the huge datasets. A pilot study has been carried out in Northwest part of India to demonstrate the effectiveness of mapping mean surface water for the temporal window June 2016 to March 2020 from Sentinel-2 using GEE so as to understand the patterns of surface water inundation at a regional scale.

TI Pollutant attenuation at the groundwater-surface water interface: A
   classification scheme and statistical analysis using national-scale
   nitrate data
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB A classification scheme for pollutant natural attenuation potential at the groundwater-surface water interface is presented, and its predictive power for explaining baseflow river nitrate concentration investigated. Both the classification scheme and statistical analysis are undertaken at Water Framework Directive surface water body scale for England and Wales, in baseflow conditions when relative groundwater contribution to rivers is greatest. The results of multiple regression analyses demonstrate statistically significant relationships between the classification of natural attenuation potential, its component properties, and baseflow river nitrate concentration. Natural attenuation at the groundwater-surface water interface is shown to be a significant control on observed river nitrate concentrations, albeit less influential than land-use descriptors. The results indicate that natural attenuation processes have a measurable impact on baseflow river chemistry at surface water body scale, and that consideration of natural attenuation processes at the groundwater-surface water interface would improve regional and catchment-scale risk prediction, and could help in the design of more sustainable catchment management strategies.

TI Evaluation of factors influencing surface water quality in a coalfield
   area of Damodar valley, India: a sustainable uses
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB A systematic study on the major ions and heavy metals was carried out for surface water resources of EB coalfield for water quality assessment, source apportionment and studying the geochemical processes controlling the surface water quality. Seasonal effect was not very prominent for the surface water quality parameters inclusive of metals, though some dilution was observed in some parameters during the monsoon season. Some of the parameters exceeded the drinking water limits like TDS, turbidity, NO3-, F-, total hardness and Mg2+ in surface water. The Fe concentrations exceeded the desirable limit of the BIS standard in about 26% of the water sample. The surface water chemistry of the EB coalfield is influenced by extensive coal mining activities. The principal component analysis of metals and health concerning anions demonstrated that the data were synthesised into three loading factors with Eigen values >1 and explaining about 71.4% of the total variance. The extracted factors seem to indicate geogenic sources, coal mining and associated transportation. The quality assessment of the surface water for irrigation suitability suggested that the calculated parameters (SAR, %Na, RSC and MH) of water to be in the range of good to permissible; however, at a few sites, SAR values and MH make it unsuitable for irrigation. Thus, the study exemplified the need for awareness about the contamination of surface water within EB coalfield area. The findingsof the present study may be useful to decision-makers in developing plans for surface water quality management and sustainable use.

TI Greenhouse gas emissions and financial analysis of rice paddy production
   scenarios in northern Iran
SO AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB Adopting environmentally and economically sustainable rice production systems is essential to achieve better results in terms of yield, financial profitability and eco-efficiency. This study compares the GHG emissions and the financial analysis (based on both costs and gross return and some financial indicators) in eight rice paddy production systems in northern Iran, under the combination of three factors: two water irrigation sources (groundwater by wells and surface water by rivers), two groups of rice cultivars (low-and high-yielding), and two transplanting methods (traditional and mechanical). The average total GHG emissions were 117.6% higher in groundwater than surface water systems, 12.4% higher in mechanical than traditional systems and 20.8% higher in high-yielding than low-yielding rice cultivars. The highest GHG share in groundwater systems was as average for electricity (52.2%), while in surface water systems was diesel fuel (51.0%). The best option for higher and more profitable yields among the studied rice production scenarios was the use of the surface water source for irrigation that, however, implies a higher water use. Considering irrigation water productivity, traditional cultivation and high-yielding rice cultivars coupled with irrigation from the surface water source could be preferred. In terms of yield profitability, that is summarized by the benefit/cost ratio and the productivity index, the best combination is irrigation with surface water, mechanical cultivation and high-yielding cultivars (1.99 and 1.36 kg US$-1, respectively). However, net return in relation to global warming potential (GWP) indicated that irrigation with surface water source systems, traditional cultivation and high-yielding rice cultivars proved more eco-efficient. Therefore, policies should give priority to surface water use and high-yielding cultivation.

TI Optimal Crop Planning and Conjunctive Use of Surface Water and
   Groundwater Resources Using Fuzzy Dynamic Programming
SO JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING
AB Optimal crop planning and the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater resources are imperative for the sustainable management of water resources, especially in semiarid regions. In recent years, considerable attention has been given to crop planning and water resources management under uncertainties caused by climate changes that affect irrigation planning in terms of decisions to determine the amounts of water that can/must be allocated. In this paper, optimal crop planning and conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater are developed for the Najafabad Plain, a part of the Zayandehrood River basin in west-central Iran. The fuzzy inference system (FIS) is used to account for the experience and expert judgments of decision makers and farmers to obtain optimal crop planning and cultivation with a reliable water demand based on climate conditions. In the present work, fuzzy regression is used for considering uncertainty and ambiguity in the data used in the simulation model as well as the uncertainties in interactions between surface water and groundwater. The objective function of the optimization model is to minimize shortages in supplying irrigation demands. The results are applicable to a wide range of climate conditions.

TI Patterns of nitrogen concentrations and their controls in two southern
   China urban river ecosystems
SO GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB Urbanization influences both inorganic and organic nitrogen (N) forms in aquatic ecosystems, but most urban studies focus on these forms in isolation. This can have significant effects on N biogeochemical cycle, N budgets and N pollution abatement measures. In this regard, we conducted a comprehensive seasonal study to compare the patterns and controls of surface water inorganic and organic N forms between two contrasting Fuzhou river ecosystems in southern China. Surface waters of the urban Bailongjiang River (BJR) had significantly higher dissolved inorganic N (DIN; p < 0.001) and dissolved organic N (DON; p = 0.006) as well as total dissolved N (TDN; p < 0.001) than those of the suburban Wulongjiang River (WJR). This suggests that the BJR surface waters are currently experiencing elevated levels of anthropogenically driven N pollution, which can adversely affect the aquatic and human health. Surface waters during the summer were generally characterized by much lower N concentrations resulting from increased precipitation-driven dilution effects and temperature-induced biological activities than those across the other seasons (p < 0.05 in most cases). The ammonium-N (NH4+-N)/nitrate-N (NO3--N) ratios were <1 whereas the DIN/DON ratios were >1, indicating the dominance of NO3--N over NH4+-N in surface water DIN and DIN over DON in surface water TDN across rivers and seasons. In addition, the contributions of NH4+-N, NO3--N and DON to the TDN followed the NO3--N > DON > NH4+-N pattern in the BJR and WJR surface waters. During the entire course of the study, the concentrations of different surface water N forms were strongly positively correlated with each other (p < 0.05 in all cases), indicating that these investigated N forms were both influenced by urbanization-driven anthropogenic activities. Surface water N concentrations increased significantly with increasing precipitation and soil N concentrations (all p < 0.05). This suggests that increasing atmospheric N deposition and soil N pollution due to rapid urbanization will have dramatic consequences on surface water eutrophication. This study emphasizes that inorganic and organic N should be collectively examined for sustainable eutrophication abatement as their patterns in urban aquatic ecosystems are not only controlled by complex processes but also interdependent.

TI Remote Sensing of Surface Water Dynamics in the Context of Global
   Change-A Review
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Inland surface water is often the most accessible freshwater source. As opposed to groundwater, surface water is replenished in a comparatively quick cycle, which makes this vital resource-if not overexploited-sustainable. From a global perspective, freshwater is plentiful. Still, depending on the region, surface water availability is severely limited. Additionally, climate change and human interventions act as large-scale drivers and cause dramatic changes in established surface water dynamics. Actions have to be taken to secure sustainable water availability and usage. This requires informed decision making based on reliable environmental data. Monitoring inland surface water dynamics is therefore more important than ever. Remote sensing is able to delineate surface water in a number of ways by using optical as well as active and passive microwave sensors. In this review, we look at the proceedings within this discipline by reviewing 233 scientific works. We provide an extensive overview of used sensors, the spatial and temporal resolution of studies, their thematic foci, and their spatial distribution. We observe that a wide array of available sensors and datasets, along with increasing computing capacities, have shaped the field over the last years. Multiple global analysis-ready products are available for investigating surface water area dynamics, but so far none offer high spatial and temporal resolution.

TI The Status and Influencing Factors of Surface Water Dynamics on the
   Qinghai-Tibet Plateau During 2000-2020
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
AB The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is rich in water resources with numerous lakes, rivers, and glaciers, and, as a source of many rivers in Central Asia, it is known as the Asian Water Tower. Under global climate change, it is critical to understand the current influencing factors on surface water area in this region. Although there are numerous studies on surface water mapping, they are still limited by temporal/spatial resolution and record length. Moreover, the complicated topographic condition makes it challenging to map the surface water accurately. Here, we proposed an automatic two-step annual surface water classification framework using long time-series Landsat images and topographic information based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The results showed that the producer accuracy (PA) and user accuracy (UA) of the surface water map in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 2020 were 99% and 90%, respectively, and the Kappa coefficient reached 0.87. Our dataset showed high consistency with high-resolution images, indicating that the proposed large-scale water mapping method has great application potential. Furthermore, a new annual surface water area dataset on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from 2000 to 2020 was generated, and its relationship with climate, vegetation, permafrost, and glacier factors was explored. We found that the mean surface water area was about 59 481 km(2), and there was a significant increasing trend (=322 km(2)/year, p < 0.01) during 2000-2020 in the plateau. Greening, warming, and wetting climate conditions contributed to the increase of surface water area. Active layer thickness and permafrost types may be the most related to the decrease of surface water area. This study provides important information for ecological assessment and protection of the plateau and promotes the implementation of sustainable development goals related to surface water resources.

TI Development of Water Quality Indexes to Identify Pollutants in Vietnam's
   Surface Water
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE
AB This study presents the first water quality indexes developed to evaluate surface water in Vietnam. The basic water quality index (WQIB) can be effectively used to evaluate the spatial and temporal variations of surface water quality as well as to identify water pollutants. The overall water quality index (WQIO) can provide additional information, particularly on toxic substances contributing to water pollution. The water quality indexes developed for this paper were applied to the national surface-water quality monitoring data taken from 1999 to 2007. Water pollutants were classified into three subcategories: organic and nutrients, particulates, and bacteria. Surface water in northern and central Vietnam was poor in quality and contained organic matter, nutrients, and bacteria. Water in the southern part was mainly polluted by bacteria. Trend analysis results reveal a deterioration in water quality in those provinces under pressure from rapid population growth, urbanization, and industrialization. Vietnam has established an official policy to ensure comprehensive nationwide water quality monitoring by 2020. The implementation of water quality indexes may provide the guiding data for sustainable water-resources management in Vietnam. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000314.

TI Atlantic mercury emission determined from continuous analysis of the
   elemental mercury sea-air concentration difference within transects
   between 50 degrees N and 50 degrees S
SO GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
AB Mercury in the environment deserves serious concern because of the mobility of volatile elemental mercury (Hg-0) in the atmosphere, in combination with the harmful effect of Hg compounds on human health and the ecosystem. A major source of global atmospheric mercury is presumed to be oceanic Hg-0 emission. However, available Hg-0 surface water data to reliably estimate the ocean's mercury emissions are sparse. In this study, high-resolution surface water and air measurements of Hg-0 were carried out between Europe and South Africa in November 2008 and between South America and Europe in April-May 2009. On each cruise a strong enrichment of Hg-0 in tropical surface water was determined that apparently followed the seasonal shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). A combination of a high Hg-0 production rate constant and the actual low wind speeds, which prevented emission, probably caused the accumulation of Hg-0 in surface waters of the ITCZ. Hg-0 emissions in the tropics were significant only if wind speed variability on a monthly scale was considered, in which case the observed significant decline of total Hg in tropical surface waters during the northern winter could be explained. In the midlatitudes, increased autumn Hg-0 emissions were calculated for November in the Northern Hemisphere and for May in the Southern Hemisphere; conversely, emissions were low during both the northern and the southern spring. Mercury removal from surface waters by Hg-0 emission and sinking particles was comparable to its supply through wet and dry deposition.

TI Sustainable water resource management through conjunctive use of
   groundwater and surface water: a review
SO INNOVATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS
AB The estimations and projections for the global population show that the population is rising dramatically. Because of this, meeting the demands for infrastructure, food, and domestic and industrial water for such a large population is a critical issue for many nations. In addition, the quality and quantity of the water resources are declining as a result of overuse, climate change, and population growth. These alarming situations require an intermediate intervention to conserve and optimize the water uses. The conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater is an old but less emphasized technique practiced in many countries to fulfill human needs partially. Conjunctive use of water has the advantages such as the utilization of poor/saline water, maintaining the groundwater levels, reduction in waterlogging and secondary soil salination, reliable water availability, and increase in crop production. In line with these advantages, this study reviews the literature regarding the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater for sustainable development of irrigated agriculture. The global scenario of water resources and how the conjunctive water use aids sustainable development is first reported. Climate change, groundwater quality and conjunctive use for various basins are discussed in detail. The capabilities of various simulation-optimization models to plan water resources efficiently are presented with case studies. Reported studies indicate that by practicing the conjunctive use not only water resources are conserved but the issues like secondary soil salination and waterlogging are alleviated. The research gaps and conclusions are provided based on the literature review that may be useful for policymakers and researchers for future research and to plan the water resources sustainably.

TI Identifying the regional-scale groundwater-surface water interaction on
   the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Assessment on the interaction between groundwater and surface water (GW-SW) can generate information that is critical to regional water resource management, especially for regions that are highly dependent on groundwater resources for irrigation. This study investigated such interaction on China's Sanjiang Plain (10.9 x 10(4) km(2)) and produced results to assist sustainable regional water management for intensive agricultural activities. Methods of hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA), and statistical analysis were used in this study. One hundred two water samplings (60 from shallow groundwater, 7 from deep groundwater, and 35 from surface water) were collected and grouped into three clusters and seven sub-clusters during the analyses. The PCA analysis identified four principal components of the interaction, which explained 85.9 % variance of total database, attributed to the dissolution and evolution of gypsum, feldspar, and other natural minerals in the region that was affected by anthropic and geological (sedimentary rock mineral) activities. The analyses showed that surface water in the upper region of the Sanjiang Plain gained water from local shallow groundwater, indicating that the surface water in the upper region was relatively more resilient to withdrawal for usage, whereas in the middle region, there was only a weak interaction between shallow groundwater and surface water. In the lower region of the Sanjiang Plain, surface water lost water to shallow groundwater, indicating that the groundwater was vulnerable to pollution by pesticides and fertilizers from terrestrial sources.

TI Water Resources in Africa under Global Change: Monitoring Surface Waters
   from Space
SO SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
AB The African continent hosts some of the largest freshwater systems worldwide, characterized by a large distribution and variability of surface waters that play a key role in the water, energy and carbon cycles and are of major importance to the global climate and water resources. Freshwater availability in Africa has now become of major concern under the combined effect of climate change, environmental alterations and anthropogenic pressure. However, the hydrology of the African river basins remains one of the least studied worldwide and a better monitoring and understanding of the hydrological processes across the continent become fundamental. Earth Observation, that offers a cost-effective means for monitoring the terrestrial water cycle, plays a major role in supporting surface hydrology investigations. Remote sensing advances are therefore a game changer to develop comprehensive observing systems to monitor Africa's land water and manage its water resources. Here, we review the achievements of more than three decades of advances using remote sensing to study surface waters in Africa, highlighting the current benefits and difficulties. We show how the availability of a large number of sensors and observations, coupled with models, offers new possibilities to monitor a continent with scarce gauged stations. In the context of upcoming satellite missions dedicated to surface hydrology, such as the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT), we discuss future opportunities and how the use of remote sensing could benefit scientific and societal applications, such as water resource management, flood risk prevention and environment monitoring under current global change.

TI Cost and environmental impact of nanofiltration in treating chemically
   pre-treated surface water
SO DESALINATION
AB Nanofiltration is an effective technique in improving the organic matter removal from coagulated surface water, but the process should also be economically feasible and environmentally sustainable when applied. Cost and environmental impact of nanofiltration installed after conventional surface water treatment were calculated and evaluated at different operating parameters in this study. The installation of nanofiltration after conventional surface water treatment would increase the cost of treated water in a minimum by 0.11 EURO/m(3) in the studied case. The least cost was gained at the higher studied recovery (83%) at the driving pressure of 6 bar, where also the total environmental impact was well balanced. However, the installation of nanofiltration would increase the environmental impact of water treatment remarkably and improvements should be done to minimise these effects. The main ways to minimise the cost of nanofiltration were related to recovery of the process, energy consumption, membrane lifetime and membrane cleaning, whereas the environmental impact minimisation was mostly related to recovery of the process and energy consumption.

TI A geochemical and stable isotope investigation of
   groundwater/surface-water interactions in the Velenje Basin, Slovenia
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB The geochemical and isotopic composition of surface waters and groundwater in the Velenje Basin, Slovenia, was investigated seasonally to determine the relationship between major aquifers and surface waters, water-rock reactions, relative ages of groundwater, and biogeochemical processes. Groundwater in the Triassic aquifer is dominated by HCO3 (-), Ca2+, Mg2+ and delta C-13(DIC) indicating degradation of soil organic matter and dissolution of carbonate minerals, similar to surface waters. In addition, groundwater in the Triassic aquifer has delta O-18 and delta D values that plot near surface waters on the local and global meteoric water lines, and detectable tritium, likely reflecting recent (< 50 years) recharge. In contrast, groundwater in the Pliocene aquifers is enriched in Mg2+, Na+, Ca2+, K+, and Si, and has high alkalinity and delta C-13(DIC) values, with low SO4 (2-) and NO3 (-) concentrations. These waters have likely been influenced by sulfate reduction and microbial methanogenesis associated with coal seams and dissolution of feldspars and Mg-rich clay minerals. Pliocene aquifer waters are also depleted in O-18 and H-2, and have H-3 concentrations near the detection limit, suggesting these waters are older, had a different recharge source, and have not mixed extensively with groundwater in the Triassic aquifer.

AB Accurate mapping of Dynamics of surface water is essential for supporting sustainable water source management and socio-economic development. To obtain a dynamic map of surface water, we obtained all available Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI images (16760 scenes) of Huai River Basin from 1989 to 2017 based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The water surface extraction method combining vegetation index and water index was used to map the spatio-temporal pattern of the surface water body. Results show as follows: (1) the maximum, average and seasonal surface water area in the Huai River Basin shows a downward trend in the past three decades, but the minimum surface water area shows a slight upward trend; (2) both the number of maximum and the minimum surface water body show a downward trend in the past three decades; (3) the changes of numbers of surface water bodies are mainly depended on the number of small surface water bodies, and the changes in the area of water bodies are mainly controlled by larger surface water bodies area. The results of the Surface water mapping are expected to provide detailed information for optimizing water structure and water source management which are critical issues in this region.

TI A review of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) in surface water across 32
   countries: Sources, concentrations, and potential estrogenic effects
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) is a synthetic estrogen with very strong estrogenic potency. Due to its wide usage in human and livestock as well as its high recalcitration to biodegradation, it was ubiquitous in different environment. This review summarized EE2 concentration levels in surface waters among 32 countries across seven continents. EE2 concentrations varied greatly in different surface waters, which ranged from not detected to 17,112 ng/L. The top 10 countries ranked in the order of high to low average EE2 concentration in surface water, were Vietnam, Cambodia, China, Laos, Brazil, Argentina, Kuwait, Thailand, Indonesia and Portugal, with the respective mean concentrations of 27.7, 22.1, 21.5, 21.1, 13.6, 9.6, 9.5, 8.8, 7.6 and 6.6 ng/L. Generally speaking, the EE2 concentration levels in surface waters in developing countries were much higher than those in developed countries. EE2 in effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was the dominant source to most countries, which suggested that improving the EE2 removal performance of municipal WWTP is the key to mitigate EE2 contamination to surface water body. Livestock, hospital, pharmacy factory and aquaculture wastewaters were also the important sources, but further work should be performed to elucidate their contribution. Evaluation based on estrogenic effects, the EE2-derived estrogen equivalence in surface waters ranged from 0 to 33 ng E2/L, among which about 65% of surface waters among 32 countries were at risk or high risk, indicating global serious EE2 contamination.
   Main finding: EE2 concentration in surface waters across 32 countries were summarized, along which its potential estrogenic effects were evaluated.

TI Multiobjective Optimization for Water Resource Management in Low-Flow
   Areas Based on a Coupled Surface Water-Groundwater Model
SO JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Optimal operation of water resource systems requires understanding the interaction between the surface water and groundwater in the region of interest. Furthermore, model parameters as well as effective surface and underground factors should be estimated and calculated. This research focuses on linking the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II with a coupled surface water-groundwater model in an area of southwestern Iran. The advantage of this structure is achieving and sustaining a balance between surface water and groundwater withdrawal by considering various constraints. The optimized withdrawal from surface water and groundwater in wet and dry areas is obtained by linking the optimization algorithm with the coupled model. Application of this method in the study area can first, to some extent, enhance the demand supply reliability and contribute to reducing the groundwater drawdown at the end of the operational period. In addition, in the proposed coupled model, all the components involved in the surface water and groundwater models are linked, with data and results flowing back and forth between the two models for each computational time step. Thus, the model structure can allow decision makers to simulate surface water-groundwater interaction in the region for computing simultaneous depletions in river flow and groundwater, particularly during dry years. This structure is suggested for sustainable water resources management, particularly in low-flow areas.

TI Assessing Surface Water Losses and Gains under Rapid Urbanization for
   SDG 6.6.1 Using Long-Term Landsat Imagery in the Guangdong-Hong
   Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, China
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB As one of the most open and dynamic regions in China, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) has been urbanizing rapidly in recent decades. The surface water in the GBA also has been suffering from urbanization and intensified human activities. The study aimed to characterize the spatiotemporal patterns and assess the losses and gains of surface water caused by urbanization in the GBA via long time-series remote sensing data, which could support the progress towards sustainable development goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations, especially for measuring SDG 6.6.1 indicator. Firstly, utilizing 4750 continuous Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI images during 1986-2020 and the Google Earth Engine cloud platform, the multiple index water detection rule (MIWDR) was performed to extract surface water extent in the GBA. Secondly, we achieved surface water dynamic type classification based on annual water inundation frequency time-series in the GBA. Finally, the spatial distribution and temporal variation of urbanization-induced water losses and gains were analyzed through a land cover transfer matrix. Results showed that (1) the average minimal and maximal surface water extents of the GBA during 1986-2020 were 2017.62 km(2) and 6129.55 km(2), respectively. The maximal surface water extent fell rapidly from 7897.96 km(2) in 2001 to 5087.46 km(2) in 2020, with a loss speed of 155.41 km(2) per year (R-2 = 0.86). (2) The surface water areas of permanent and dynamic types were 1529.02 km(2) and 2064.99 km(2) during 2000-2020, accounting for 42.54% and 57.46% of all water-related areas, respectively. (3) The surface water extent occupied by impervious land surfaces showed a significant linear downward trend (R-2 = 0.98, slope = 36.41 km(2) per year), while the surface water restored from impervious land surfaces denoted a slight growing trend (R-2 = 0.86, slope = 0.99 km(2) per year). Our study monitored the long-term changes in the surface water of the GBA, which can provide valuable information for the sustainable development of the GBA urban agglomeration. In addition, the proposed framework can easily be implemented in other similar regions worldwide.

TI Changes in surface water dynamics across northwestern Canada are
   influenced by wildfire and permafrost thaw
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB The abundance and distribution of surface water at high latitudes is shifting rapidly in response to both climate change and permafrost thaw. In particular, the expansion and drainage of lakes and ponds is widespread but spatially variable, and more research is needed to understand factors driving these processes. In this study we used medium resolution (30 m) remote sensing data to analyse changes in lake area in permafrost-rich lowland regions across northwestern Canada. First, we used the Global Surface Water Dataset developed by the GLAD research group to map the absolute area of different land-water transitions across a 1.4 million km(2) study domain. Next, we selected six regional study areas representing a range of climatic, geologic and hydrologic conditions. Within these regional study areas, we used the Landsat satellite archive to map annual trends in the area of 27 755 lakes between 1985 and 2020. We trained a random forests model to classify lakes exhibiting significant increasing or decreasing trends in area, and assessed the relative importance of climate, disturbance and environmental variables in determining the direction of change. Our analysis shows that significant increases in lake area were 5.6 times more frequent than decreases during the study period. Wildfire and ground ice abundance were the most important predictors of the direction of change. Greater ground ice content was associated with regions that experienced increases in lake area, while wildfire was associated with regions that experienced decreases in lake area. The effects of climate, including trends in mean annual temperature and total annual precipitation were smaller than disturbance and environmental factors, indicating that climate has likely had indirect effects on lake area changes over our period of study.

TI Optimal Agricultural Water Allocation for the Sustainable Development of
   Surface and Groundwater Resources
SO WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB This paper presents a multiobjective linear program for the optimal allocation of water resources among various crops in a large canal command area of Pakistan. The available surface water in the canal cannot meet the net irrigation requirement (NIR) of various crops, which leads to the overexploitation of groundwater and causes salinity problems. Therefore, an optimal water allocation model was formulated using the simultaneous compromise constraint (SICCON) technique for the sustainable development of surface water and groundwater. Three (03) single objective functions (OFs) and a multiobjective function (MOF) were considered in this study. The MOF combines the single OFs by developing an arrangement among them to both maximize the satisfaction rate for surface water (SRs) and net economic returns (NER) and minimize the salinity problems. The available surface water (AW) of 1531 Mm(3) was allocated among various crops, i.e., wheat, cotton, sugarcane, rice, onion, and sunflower, using the SICCON technique, and the deficit was accounted for with groundwater reserves. The model results showed an average increase of 22% in SRs and 7.2 million USD in NERs from surface water allocation compared to the current water allocation practice. Moreover, the salinity levels of the allocated water exceed the threshold limits of onion, sugarcane, and rice crops in the current water allocation system and thereby negatively impact agricultural production. Hence, the model used in this study may support decision-makers in the optimal selection of different crops to be irrigated to maximize the SRs and NERs and minimize salinity problems.

TI Characterizing surface water and groundwater interaction for sustainable
   water resources management in southwestern Ohio
SO SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB The interaction between surface water and groundwater (SW-GW) influences the quantity and quality of water. This study was conducted in the Great Miami River Basin (GMRB), southwestern Ohio where groundwater is the source of drinking water for 2.3 million people. We used stable water isotopes, hydro-geo-chemistry, and water level data to provide vital information on seasonal and spatial variation of the degree of SW-GW interaction. This combined assessment suggests that SW-GW interaction is mainly controlled by local geology, groundwater depth, the proximity of groundwater wells to rivers, and seasonal precipitation distribution. In the basin, the hydrochemistry of the surface water and groundwater is generally similar (Calcium-Magnesium-Bicarbonate) and likely influenced by the geology of the region. Using the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water quality index (CCME WQI), we ranked the drinking water quality of surface water as fair to good (WQI, 71-88%) and groundwater quality as good to excellent (QWI, 84-100%). The findings from this study demonstrate variable SW-GW interaction in different parts of the GMRB and suggest the need to adapt customized sustainable water management plans that protect both water resources.

TI Characterizing Differences in Sources of and Contributions to Fecal
   Contamination of Sediment and Surface Water with the Microbial FIT
   Framework
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Surface water monitoring and microbial source tracking (MST) are used to identify host sources of fecal pollution and protect public health. However, knowledge of the locations of spatial sources and their relative impacts on the environment is needed to effectively mitigate health risks. Additionally, sediment samples may offer time-integrated information compared to transient surface water. Thus, we implemented the newly developed microbial find, inform, and test framework to identify spatial sources and their impacts on human (HuBac) and bovine (BoBac) MST markers, quantified from both riverbed sediment and surface water in a bovinedense region. Dairy feeding operations and low-intensity developed land-cover were associated with 99% (p-value < 0.05) and 108% (p-value < 0.05) increases, respectively, in the relative abundance of BoBac in sediment, and with 79% (p-value < 0.05) and 39% increases in surface water. Septic systems were associated with a 48% increase in the relative abundance of HuBac in sediment and a 56% increase in surface water. Stronger source signals were observed for sediment responses compared to water. By defining source locations, predicting river impacts, and estimating source influence ranges in a Great Lakes region, this work informs pollution mitigation strategies of local and global significance.

TI A large-scale conjunctive management model of water resources for an

SO HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
AB The quantity of available water resources has been recognized as the key limiting factor for development of most of the arid regions. This paper focuses on the simulation optimization for conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater on a large scale. In this study, Hetao Irrigation District in China, one of the largest irrigation districts in the Yellow River basin, is selected as a representative study area. The conjunctive management model of water resources is developed by means of dynamically coupling a large-scale hydrological model with an optimal allocation model. A groundwater level is adopted in the coupled model as the constraint condition and the optimal conjunctive utilization quantity of surface water and groundwater is set as the objective function. Finally, the coupled model is applied to calculate the optimal water supply quantity of surface water and groundwater and sustainable utilization scheme of water resources for 2020 and 2030 in Hetao Irrigation District. The modeling results demonstrate the conjunctive management model of water resources is an effective tool for appraising water resources in large-scale arid regions.

TI Effects of lithium resource exploitation on surface water at Jiajika
   mine, China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB Heavy metal and metalloid (HMM) contamination of the water environment caused by mining activities is a great challenge to the global mining industry. HMMs released by various mines could easily enter the surrounding environment and pose serious threats to human health. Although the HMM pollution of surface water in various mines has been widely researched, relevant studies on the effects of mining activities on the surface water of hard-rock-type Li mines are scarce. Herein, a total of 81 water samples were collected from Jiajika mine for the first time, the largest hard-rock-type Li mine in Asia. The physical parameters and concentrations of HMMs and major ions of the samples were analyzed to evaluate the water quality and HMM level of surface water. Results showed that (1) most of the parameters analyzed adhered to the strictest guidelines of Chinese surface waters and the drinking water guidelines of WHO, except Mn, Pb, and As of a few samples from tailings-affected areas and Li-bearing areas; (2) mineral tailings obviously increased the pH and decreased the dissolved oxygen (DO) of the surrounding surface waters; (3) the highest concentrations of As (5.58 mu g/L), Zn (81.8 mu g/L), Ba (5.26 mu g/L), and Co (0.33 mu g/L) were observed around the tailings reservoir, whereas the highest concentrations of Cr (1.5 mu g/L), Mn (380 mu g/L), Pb (28.4 mu g/L), and V (3.16 mu g/L) were observed in Li-bearing areas; and (4) according to the statistical results, the concentrations of As, Cr, Ni, and V in surface water were mainly affected by mining activities, whereas those of Cu, Zn, Ba, Co, and Pb were dominantly affected by natural processes. These results provide useful information about water quality in relation to Li mining and can help the government make reasonable decisions regarding hard-rock-type Li resource exploitation activities.

TI Sustainable groundwater management through an optimal water supply
   system using a coupled simulation-optimization approach
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB Meeting people's water supply needs in cities is an urgent challenge. Especially in coastal cities, surface water sources are usually inadequate and so groundwater is frequently over-exploited, resulting in its rapid decrease and intrusion of saltwater. Conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater is the best alternative approach to mitigate the overuse of groundwater through effective distribution of surface water sources. It requires numerous runs of the simulation-optimization model to select an optimal pattern of water distribution by keeping the groundwater levels under control. In this study, a new simulation-optimization model is developed using wavelet support vector regression (WSVR) and genetic algorithm (GA) to propose an optimal water distribution system to Visakhapatnam city on the East Coast of India, fulfilling the constraints of surface water quantity, aquifer pumping, and drawdown. Estimation of groundwater pumping and groundwater level variation in spatial context is challenging in urban environment. To overcome this, the calibrated modular finite-difference flow (MODFLOW) model for this study area has been used to prepare the spatial and temporal variation of model inputs such as groundwater pumping and groundwater levels. The WSVR-GA model's performance to reduce the groundwater pumping is evaluated in three distinct cases. The surface water resources from three sources are distributed to different wards in the city source-wise in case I and centralized in cases II and III, while the source-wise surface water constraints are limited to monthly in cases I and II and annual in case III. The WSVR-GA management model suggested ward-wise groundwater pumping restrictions, resulting in 9.57 MCM, 11.64 MCM, and 12.54 MCM increase in total groundwater storage capacity in cases I, II, and III respectively. Cases II and III offer 21% and 25%, respectively, more storage than case I. Thus, centralized distribution systems have increased the sustainability of groundwater supplies by preventing overdrafts caused by a lack of surface water resources. Validation of results using MODFLOW indicates a substantial rise in groundwater levels in the study area.

TI Conductivity as an indicator of surface water quality in the proximity
   of ferrochrome smelters in South Africa
SO WATER SA
AB South Africa is one of the leading ferrochrome (FeCr) producing countries. One of the main environmental and health-related issues associated with FeCr production is the possible generation of Cr(VI). However, Cr(VI) is not the only potential pollutant that has to be considered during FeCr production. Various water-soluble species are present in FeCr waste materials and in process water. Considering the size of the South African FeCr industry and its global importance, it is essential to assess the extent of potential surface water pollution in the proximity of FeCr smelters by such water-soluble species. In this study water conductivity was measured as a proxy of general water quality. Although deposition was not measured, comparison of surface water results indicated that atmospheric deposition of pollutants originating from FeCr smelting did not significantly impact surface water quality, but that surface run-off and/or groundwater leaching were the main contributors. At two FeCr smelters it was observed that these smelters did not impact surface water quality negatively. In contrast, surface water pollution originating from at least four FeCr smelters was apparent. However, only at one smelter did pollution result in surface water conductivity that indicated a water quality not fit for human consumption. No correlations could be made between potable water quality and possible pollution from FeCr smelters. Notwithstanding this limitation, it was found that potable water sampled at all sites complied with the conductivity criteria for human consumption.

TI Rapid surface water intervention performance comparison for urban

SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Surface water flooding can be a significant source of damage and disruption in urban areas. The complexity of urban surfaces, the need for spatially disaggregated approaches and the multiplicity of interventions makes management challenging from a number of perspectives. This research responds to the challenge of selecting appropriate surface water management interventions by applying a fast assessment framework to generate evidence for comparing strategies at low resource cost during initial design. This is demonstrated by simulating flood dynamics and comparing damage costs in 144 flood scenarios. The main finding of this work is that a high-level quantitative assessment of large numbers of scenarios is capable of providing evidence to identify performance trends and consider resilience to extreme events at an early stage of planning.

TI Precipitation events impact on urban lake surface water temperature
   under the perspective of macroscopic scale
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is an important factor affecting a lake's ecological environment. In recent decades, LSWT worldwide has shown an increasing trend in the context of global climate change. This rising trend has been more evident in urban lakes. With the rapid development of urbanization, urban lakes are affected not only by climate warming but also by human activities. Among these factors, due to the increase in impervious surface coverage (ISC), the impact of thermal runoff pollution caused by precipitation events on urban lakes cannot be ignored. Therefore, this study used the Dianchi Lake watershed as a study area, and the surface water temperature of Dianchi Lake, the precipitation data, and the land use data were collected and analyzed. Based on these data, the influence of precipitation events on the surface water temperature of Dianchi Lake was analyzed. The research results show that under the background of different ISC levels and different growth rates of impervious surface area (ISA), precipitation events have different effects on the LSWT. When ISC is low and the growth rate of ISA is slow, the annual precipitation is negatively correlated with the annual average surface water temperature of Dianchi Lake (r = - 0.183). When ISC is high and the growth rate of ISA is fast, the annual precipitation is positively correlated with the average annual surface water temperature of Dianchi Lake (r = 0.65). With the increase in ISC, the correlation between seasonal precipitation and the average surface water temperature in Dianchi Lake changed from negative to positive in spring and autumn. Under the action of impervious surfaces, precipitation events have a warming effect on the surface water temperature of the lake, and this effect will be intensified with the increase in ISC.

TI Rapidly declining surface and terrestrial water resources in Central
   Asia driven by socio-economic and climatic changes
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB A systematic understanding of the dynamics of surface water resources and terrestrial water storage (TWS) is extremely important for human survival in Central Asia (CA) and maintaining the balance of regional ecosystems. Although several remote sensing products have been used to map surface water, the spatial resolution of some of them (hundreds of meters) is not sufficient to identify small surface water bodies, with monitoring data only being available for a few years or less. Thus, long-term continuous monitoring of surface water dynamics has not yet been achieved. To address this, we used all available Landsat images and the adjacent-years interpolation method to describe the dynamics of surface water in CA with a 30-m spatial resolution during 1990-2019. Subsequently, based on the multiple stepwise regression model, the climatic changes and human activity drivers affecting the surface water were systematically assessed. The permanent surface water areas (PSWA) of downstream countries with water scarcity decreased over time. The PSWA of Kazakhstan continues to decline at a maximum rate of 1189 km(2)/a. Additionally, human activities represented by population and reservoir areas are the dominant drivers affecting surface water resources in CA. The relationship between TWS and PSWA in CA and the constraints on social and economic development provided by the available water resources are discussed. The findings demonstrate that more than one-third of the croplands in CA are suffering from declining SWAs and TWS. The water crisis in CA has intensified, and the spatial mismatch between water and land resources is expected to remain one of the biggest challenges for future social and economic development in CA. Our dataset and findings provide high-precision surface water dynamics data that could be valuable for mitigating the water crisis in CA and provide a current scientific reference for achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.

TI Correlation between Spatial-Temporal Variation in Landscape Patterns and
   Surface Water Quality: A Case Study in the Yi River Watershed, China
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The evidence for a correlation between landscape patterns and surface water quality is still weak. We chose the Yi River watershed in China as a study area. We selected and determined the chemical oxygen demand, ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, and electric conductivity to represent the surface water quality. We analyzed the spatial distribution of the surface water quality. Buffer zones with five different radii were built around each sampling site to analyze landscape patterns on different scales. A correlation analysis was completed to examine the influencing rules and the response mechanisms between landscape patterns and surface water quality indicators. The results show that: (1) Different landscape composition types impact the surface water quality differently and increasing the area of forest land can effectively reduce non-point source pollution, (2) an increase in urban area may threaten the surface water quality, and (3) landscape compositional change has a greater influence on surface water quality compared to landscape configurational change. This study provides a scientific foundation for the spatial development of watersheds and outlines a strategy for improving the sustainability of surface water quality and the surrounding environment.

TI The Dark Side of Microbial Processes: Accumulation of Nitrate During
   Storage of Surface Water in the Dark and the Underlying Mechanism
SO MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
AB In densely populated cities with limited land, storage of surface water in underground spaces is a potential solution to meet the rising demand of clean water. In addition, due to the imperative need of renewable solar energy and limited land resources, the deployment of floating solar photovoltaic (PV) systems over water has risen exponentially. In both scenarios, microbial communities in the water do not have access to sunlight How the absence of sunlight influences microbial community function and the water quality is largely unknown. The objective of this study was to reveal microbial processes in surface water stored in the dark and water quality dynamics. Water from a freshwater reservoir was stored in the dark or light (control) for 6 months. Water quality was monitored at regular intervals. RNA sequencing was performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform and qPCR was used to substantiate the findings arising from the sequencing data. Our results showed that storage of surface water in the dark resulted in the accumulation of nitrate in the water. Storage in the dark promoted the decay of algal cells, increasing the amount of free nitrogen in the water. Most of the free nitrogen was eventually transformed into nitrate through microbial processes. RNA sequencing-based microbial community analyses and pure culture experiments using nitrifying bacteria Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrobacter sp. revealed that the accumulation of nitrate in the dark was likely due to an increase in nitrification rate and a decrease in the assimilation rate of nitrate back into the biomass.
   IMPORTANCE Microbial communities play an essential role in maintaining a healthy aquatic ecosystem. For example, in surface water reservoirs, microorganisms produce oxygen, break down toxic contaminants and remove excess nitrogen. In densely populated cities with limited land, storing surface water in underground spaces and deploying floating solar photovoltaic (PV) systems over water are potential solutions to address water and energy sustainability challenges. In both scenarios, surface water is kept in the dark. In this work, we revealed how the absence of sunlight influences microbial community function and water quality. We showed that storage of surface water in the dark affected bacterial activities responsible for nitrogen transformation, resulting in the accumulation of nitrate in the water. Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring nitrate closely if raw surface water is to be stored in the dark and the potential need of downstream treatment to remove nitrate.

TI An Assessment of Surface Water Detection Methods for Water Resource
   Management in the Nigerien Sahel
SO SENSORS
AB Water is a scarce, but essential resource in the Sahel. Rainfed ephemeral ponds and lakes that dot the landscape are necessary to the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and pastoralists who rely on these resources to irrigate crops and hydrate cattle. The remote location and dispersed nature of these water bodies limits typical methods of monitoring, such as with gauges; fortunately, remote sensing offers a quick and cost-effective means of regularly measuring surface water extent in these isolated regions. Dozens of operational methods exist to use remote sensing to identify waterbodies, however, their performance when identifying surface water in the semi-arid Sahel has not been well-documented and the limitations of these methods for the region are not well understood. Here, we evaluate two global dynamic surface water datasets, fifteen spectral indices developed to classify surface water extent, and three simple decision tree methods created specifically to identify surface water in semi-arid environments. We find that the existing global surface water datasets effectively minimize false positives, but greatly underestimate the presence and extent of smaller, more turbid water bodies that are essential to local livelihoods, an important limitation in their use for monitoring water availability. Three of fifteen spectral indices exhibited both high accuracy and threshold stability when evaluated over different areas and seasons. The three simple decision tree methods had mixed performance, with only one having an overall accuracy that compared to the best performing spectral indices. We find that while global surface water datasets may be appropriate for analysis at the global scale, other methods calibrated to the local environment may provide improved performance for more localized water monitoring needs.

TI How small is the big problem? Small microplastics < 300 mu m abundant in
   marine surface waters of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB Particle size plays an important role in determining the behaviour, fate and effects of microplastics (MPs), yet little is known about MPs <300 mu m in aquatic environments. Therefore, we performed the first assessment of MPs in marine surface waters around the Whitsunday Islands region of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia, to test for the presence of small MPs (50-300 mu m) in-situ. Using a modified manta net, we demonstrate that MPs were present in all marine surface water samples, with a mean sea surface concentration of 0.23 +/- 0.03 particles m(-3). Microplastics were mainly blue, clear and black fibres and fragments, consisting of polyethylene tere-phthalate, high-density polyethylene and polypropylene plastic polymers. Tourism and marine recreation were considered the major contributing sources of MPs to surface waters around the Whitsunday Islands. Between 10 and 124 times the number of MPs exist in the 50 mu m-300 mu m size class, compared with the 1 mm-5 mm size range. This finding indicates that the global abundance of small MPs in marine surface waters is grossly underestimated and warrants further investigation. Research into the occurrence, characteristics and environ-mental fate of MPs <300 mu m is needed to improve our understanding of the cumulative threats facing valuable ecosystems due to this smaller, potentially more hazardous size class.

TI Tracing surface water change from 1990 to 2020 in China's Shandong
   Province using Landsat series images
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB Accurate and long-term series surface water extraction is of great significance for development of agro-ecosystem and sustainable management of water resources. Data and knowledge of the spatial-temporal dynamics of surface water are still very limited in Shandong Province, China. This study provides a rapid and robust method for open-surface water detecting based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The 30-m annual maps of surface water frequency are generated to analyze the distribution and variation of surface water in Shandong Province during 1990-2020. In addition, the effects of climatic and anthropogenic drivers are investigated on the temporal and spatial dynamics of surface water. A previously published global surface water dataset is used to valid our results. The results show that the correlation coefficient (R) of permanent surface water area (SWA) is 0.95 from 1990 to 2020. And in this study, the surface water area is well extracted in 1994 which is underestimated by Joint Research Centre (JRC). Surface water is widely distributed in Shandong Province; however, the interannual variation of SWA is substantial. The permanent SWA presents an increasing trend in Shandong Province, especially from 1990 to 2004. Multitemporal monitoring results show that the permanent SWA of Dongping Lake, Xiashan Reservoir, and Chanzhi Reservoir fluctuate most in 1990-1994 and 2013-2018. Precipitation and water supply significantly affect the permanent SWA, with R of 0.38 and -0.70. The results will provide a critical guidance for implementing sustainable water resources management so as to avoid flood-hazards and drought disasters.

TI Trends in Demand of Urban Surface Water Extractions and in Situ Use
   Functions
SO WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB Scientific literature currently lacks comprehensive understanding of urban surface water use functions. This hampers sound analysis of the demand and potential supply of these functions. This study provides a comprehensive overview of potential use functions, by integrating knowledge from ecosystem services and integrated urban water management fields. Analysis of water-related management plans for Toronto and Amsterdam shows that surface water is currently being used for a variety of functions related to nutrition, energy, water regulation, recreation, symbolic use, transportation and floating buildings. Notably, many use functions involve in situ use, rather than water extractions. Interviewed water managers and spatial planners in both cities expect demand of most use functions to increase by 2040, especially demand for thermal energy extraction, recreation and transportation. Some identified novel demands, such as climate regulation and reuse of waste products from waterway maintenance. Increasing demand is mainly driven by urban growth, climate change and sustainability ambitions. This study found urban surface water uses that are usually not acknowledged in scientific literature on urban water management. This comprehensive overview supports planning, design, and maintenance of urban surface waters, laying the foundation for future research on supply and demand of urban water use functions.

TI Hydrochemical assessment for the suitability of drinking and irrigation
   use of surface water in Grouz Dam Basin, Northeast Algeria
SO SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB Surface water quality is critical for regional and local community needs in Grouz Dam basin, NE Algeria. Subsequently, this research was assessed out to analyze the surface water suitability for drinking and irrigation and also aims to measure the degree of the hydrochemical implications to the sustainable control of water resources in this basin. Throughout this study, the aptness of surface waters for domestic use was assessed via evaluating the physicochemical levels with the recommended values for potable water settled by the WHO and water quality index. The values of the considered parameters are below the maximum tolerable limits for drinking except for Na+, NO32-, Fe, Cu, Al and turbidity. The suitability for irrigation was appraised using multiple agricultural water quality indicators like SAR, Na% and RSC. The ionic dominance in water changed into descending order of Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ for cations and of Cl- > (HCO3- + CO32- > SO42- > NO3- for anions and, in all waters, two facies were determined. The hydrochemical analysis divulges that weathering and dissolution additionally to the anthropogenic activity are the dominant hydrogeochemical processes governing and/ or influencing water chemistry in Grouz Dam Basin. The overall surface waters are good for irrigation use and presenting a low salinity hazard but unsuitable for drinking. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the surface water quality and to implement and formulate an integrated plan to control the level of anthropogenic occurring contamination. It is recommended to carry out a systematic water quality monitoring program and development of effective management practices for water resources utilization in order to their best protection and sustainable preservation in this region of Algeria.

TI Contrasting Community Composition and Co-Occurrence Relationships of the
   Active Pico-Sized Haptophytes in the Surface and Subsurface Chlorophyll
   Maximum Layers of the Arctic Ocean in Summer
SO MICROORGANISMS
AB Haptophytes (Hacrobia: Haptophyta), which can perform phototrophic, phagotrophic, or mixotrophic nutritional modes, are critical for element cycling in a variety of aquatic ecosystems. However, their diversity, particularly in the changing Arctic Ocean (AO), remains largely unknown. In the present study, the biodiversity, community composition, and co-occurrence networks of pico-sized haptophytes in the surface water and subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) layer of the AO were explored. Our results found higher alpha diversity estimates in the surface water compared with in the SCM based on high-throughput sequencing of haptophyte specific 18S rRNA. The community composition of the surface water was significantly different from that of the SCM, and water temperature was identified as the primary factor shaping the community compositions. Prymnesiales (mostly Chrysochromulina), uncultured Prymnesiophyceae, and Phaeocystis dominated the surface water communities, whereas Phaeocystis dominated the SCM communities, followed by Chrysochromulina, uncultured Prymnesiophyceae, and the remaining taxa. The communities of the surface water and SCM layer developed relatively independent modules in the metacommunity network. Nodes in the surface water were more closely connected to one another than those in the SCM. Network stability analysis revealed that surface water networks were more stable than SCM networks. These findings suggest that SCM communities are more susceptible to environmental fluctuations than those in surface water and that future global changes (e.g., global warming) may profoundly influence the development, persistence, and service of SCM in the AO.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This study aims to determine the effectiveness and rank the scenarios for the modernization of surface water distribution system in reducing water withdrawal from the aquifers, including the replacement of catchment structures (structural method), improving traditional water distribution methods (nonstructural method), and automation of surface water distribution system (combined method). The surface water distribution system of the Nekouabad area located in the central plateau of Iran was selected as the study area. A set of technical (increasing groundwater level), social (water distribution equity), economic (implementation cost), and environmental (integrated groundwater footprint) criteria were selected to study the balancing scenarios for sustainable groundwater management comprehensively. The performance of surface water distribution was simulated in MATLAB software, and its effect on the aquifer was studied using the MODFLOW code. The criteria were weighted by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, and the balancing scenarios were prioritized using two multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods, i.e., AHP and COPRAS. The scenario ranking results using the two MCDM methods indicated that the combined method, two improvement scenarios of the non-structural method, and the structural method had the highest to lowest priorities. The results showed that the option of automation of surface water distribution systems could be introduced as a practical and effective solution in balancing aquifers where agricultural water management is based on a combination of surface and groundwater resources.

The heavy metal contamination of surface water and ground water by mining activities in Gejiu tin-polymetallic mining area, Southwest China, was studied. Surface water and ground water were sampled and analyzed using AAS for Cr6+, Cd, As, Hg, Cu, Pb, Zn, Se, Fe and Mn. Analysis of HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, F-and NO3-in water samples was also undertaken by ion chromatography. It was shown that none of water samples exceeded the guideline of Cr6+, Se and Hg, while the contamination degree of heavy metals was Mn > Fe > Cd > Zn > Pb > As > Cu, all of which were serious contamination except mild contamination for Cu. The ground waters were polluted much worse than surface water.

TI Preliminary analysis of spatiotemporal pattern of global land surface
   water
SO SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
AB Land surface water (LSW) is one of the most important resources for human survival and development, and it is also a main component of global water recycling. A full understanding of the spatial distribution of land surface water and a continuous measuring of its dynamics can support to diagnose the global ecosystem and environment. Based on the Global Land 30-water 2000 and Global Land 30-water 2010 products, this research analyzed the spatial distribution pattern and temporal fluctuation of land surface water under scale-levels of global, latitude and longitude, continents, and climate zones. The Global Land 30-water products were corrected the temporal inconsistency of original remotely sensed data using MODIS time-series data, and then calculated the indices such as water area, water ration and coefficient of spatial variation for further analysis. Results show that total water area of land surface is about 3.68 million km(2) (2010), and occupies 2.73% of land area. The spatial distribution of land surface water is extremely uneven and is gathered mainly in mid- to high-latitude area of the Northern Hemisphere and tropic area. The comparison of water ratio between 2000 and 2010 indicates the overall fluctuation is small but spatially differentiated. The Global Land 30-water products and the statistics provided the fundamental information for analyzing the spatial distribution pattern and temporal fluctuation of land surface water and diagnosing the global ecosystem and environment.

TI Surface water dynamics analysis based on sentinel imagery and Google
   Earth Engine Platform: a case study of Jayakwadi dam
SO SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB Surface water is important for the urban and agriculture ecosystem, the accurate and very easy to detect and analysis of the surface water based on the remote sensing data and google earth engine platform. It is a very much important for irrigation and water resource management during the dry period and rabi with summer season. In this paper, we have extracted the surface water analysis from Sentinel-2A images using a new technique of Google Earth Engine (GEE) and machine learning coding. Monitoring the dynamics of surface water is a very helpful to study of the irrigation, and drinking water requirement, which climate change factors most damages on the surface water, natural environmental health and understand the impacts of global changes and human actions on the planning and development of the water resources in the semi-arid region. Currently, so much research has focused on the surface water extraction and dynamic monitoring using remote sensing imagery and softwares. But downloading a big number of remote sensing images are covering that area and then process in the remote sensing and GIS software as per the traditional method. The traditional process is much lengthy, also very time-wasting for such kind of time series dataset analysis. In this view, GEE platform has been given easier to access any satellite data within less time. The GEE is a total cloud-based platform enthusiastic to satellite image data processing based on the machine learning coding. So for many excellent remote sensing image processing coding, algorithms have been integrated in the platform of Google Earth Engine (GEE). These data do not require to save images and collection, which are very easy to doing satellite data processing and effective output capability. The results show that 2019 year has observed that there are increased water area, i.e. 202.4871 km(2) and for the year of 2019, water spread-out area is 410.9113 km(2) in dam. To compare the results of 2015-2019, there is much increase in the water area due to various reasons like pumping, heavy rain, etc. in the Jayakwadi dam. This water can use for various purposes and irrigation water management and drinking purposes during the drought condition. The developed algorithms have given better information and results of water spread-out by google earth engine. The current techniques are reliable, novel, and quick to get the maximum and minimum extent of the surface water. The results can be very useful for the surface water planning and management in the study area.

TI Hydrological and Isotopic Variability of Perched Wetlands on North
   Stradbroke Island (Minjerribah), Australia: Implications for
   Understanding the Effects of Past and Future Climate Change
SO FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Over the first two decades of the 21st century, many wetlands in eastern Australia exhibited declining water levels, causing concern for communities and environmental managers and raising questions about the roles of climate change and other human activity in these water level declines. In this context we examine the causes of water level variability in four wetlands on North Stradbroke Island (Minjerribah), in the humid subtropics of south-eastern Queensland, Australia, using a combination of hydrological and water isotope monitoring and modelling. North Stradbroke Island has a high concentration of wetlands perched above the regional water table, with cultural and ecological significance, and value for palaeoclimate research. From 2015 to 2019, wetland water depths decreased markedly at all sites, coinciding with increases in oxygen isotope ratios in surface waters. The data indicate that climate, specifically a decrease in precipitation relative to evaporation, was responsible for those declining water levels, and that groundwater extraction did not play a critical role. At two of the sites-both palustrine wetlands-declining surface water levels led to intermittent connectivity with the local perched aquifers. At the other two sites, which are both shallow lakes, the surface waters were constantly fed by perched groundwater. The hydrology of the two lakes was modelled using simple mass balance. However, in order to accurately model lake level change, it was necessary to vary catchment runoff and lake outflow via groundwater through time, highlighting complexity in projecting future hydrological change in these lakes. The long term resilience of these lakes depends on a combination of rainfall regime and the balance between catchment runoff and groundwater throughflow, the future of which is highly uncertain. As a consequence, continued efforts to project future hydroclimate and to model the complex hydrology of subtropical wetlands are essential.

TI An integrated approach for identification of waterlogged areas using RS
   and GIS technique and groundwater modelling
SO SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB An integrated approach using remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) and groundwater modelling (GM) has been used for waterlogged areas identification in the Rohtak district of Haryana State, India. Surface waterlogged areas were delineated using optical remote sensing satellite data-based normalized difference water index (NDWI) technique. Sentinel 2 MSS (optical data) images pertaining to pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons were acquired and processed to extract water pixels. To overcome the limitation of false positives and cloud penetration associated with optical images, water pixels were also extracted using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of Sentinel 1A. Thresholding of NDWI for optical images and sigma naught for SAR images was done using the respective histograms to distinguish water and terrestrial features. Surface waterlogged areas were delineated from the generated combined water body raster based on the visual interpretation technique in a GIS environment. Sub-surface waterlogging conditions were simulated for the same year using process-based groundwater model MODFLOW. A conceptual model was created to simulate groundwater system based on flow processes, hydrogeological characteristics, aquifer hydraulic properties, source and sinks and boundary conditions. Sub-surface waterlogged areas were delineated based on depth to water table classification criteria. It was found that surface waterlogged area varies from 0.55 to 1.0% of the district area from pre-monsoon to post-monsoon season, while the percentage of sub-surface waterlogged areas was higher, varying from 9.1 to 21.6%, respectively. Statistics also shows that most of the surface waterlogged areas do not fall under the areas plagued by sub-surface waterlogging.

TI Global modelling of surface water quality: a multi-pollutant approach
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB In many world regions the availability of clean water is at risk. Pollution of rivers and coastal seas poses a threat to aquatic ecosystems and society. Here, we review representative examples of mathematical models that simulate pollutant flows from land to sea at global and continental scales. We argue that a multi-pollutant modelling approach would help to better understand and manage water quality issues. Pollutants often have common sources and multiple impacts. Most existing spatially explicit models, however, focus on one type of pollution only. A new generation of models is needed to explicitly address the combined exposure of surface waters to multiple pollutants. Such models could serve as a basis for integrated water quantity and water quality assessments.

CL Stockholm, SWEDEN
SP Stockholm Int Water Inst
AB The Water Framework Directive (WFD) is a new legislative framework to manage, use, protect, and restore surface water and groundwater resources and coastal waters in the European Union (EU). The aim is to ensure sustainable water management and to reach good water quality by 2015. The assessment of the ecological status and setting of the practical management goals require several steps. The process has started with the characterisation of the river basins including identification of surface water bodies and types, and identification of significant anthropogenic pressures and impacts. The water bodies will be classified in five quality classes (high, good, moderate, poor, bad) based on the Ecological Quality Ratio, which is a ratio between reference conditions and measured status of the biological quality elements. The normative criteria for high, good and moderate ecological status described in the WFD need to be made operational because those will be used to set the practical quality targets for surface water management. National ecological assessment systems and classifications will be harmonised through the WFD intercalibration exercise in order to ensure an equal level of ambition in achieving good surface waters status all over Europe.

TI Interactions between groundwater and surface water: the state of the
   science
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB The interactions between groundwater and surface water are complex. To understand these interactions in relation to climate, landform, geology, and biotic factors, a sound hydrogeoecological framework is needed. All these aspects are synthesized and exemplified in this overview. In addition, the mechanisms of interactions between groundwater and surface water (GW-SW) as they affect recharge-discharge processes are comprehensively outlined, and the ecological significance and the human impacts of such interactions are emphasized. Surface-water and groundwater ecosystems are viewed as linked components of a hydrologic continuum leading to related sustainability issues. This overview concludes with a discussion of research needs and challenges facing this evolving field. The biogeochemical processes within the upper few centimeters of sediments beneath nearly all surface-water bodies (hyporheic zone) have a profound effect on the chemistry of the water interchange, and here is where most of the recent research has been focusing. However, to advance conceptual and other modeling of GW-SW systems, a broader perspective of such interactions across and between surfacewater bodies is needed, including multidimensional analyses, interface hydraulic characterization and spatial variability, site-to-region regionalization approaches, as well as cross-disciplinary collaborations.

TI Mass Balance of Perfluoroalkyl Acids, Including Trifluoroacetic Acid, in
   a Freshwater Lake
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are highly persistent chemicals that are ubiquitously found in the environment. The atmospheric degradation of precursor compounds has been identified as a source of PFAAs and might be an important pathway for contamination. Lake Vattern is one of Sweden's largest lakes and is an important source for drinking water. In addition to contamination via atmospheric deposition, the lake is subject to several potential contamination sources via surface water inflow. The relevance of different sources is not well understood. A mass balance of selected PFAAs was assembled based on measured concentrations in atmospheric deposition, surface water from streams that constitute the main inflow and outflow, and surface water in the lake. The largest input was seen for trifluoroacetic acid (150 kg/year), perfluoropropanoic acid (1.6 kg/year), perfluorobutanoic acid (4.0 kg/year), and perfluoro-octanoic acid (1.5 kg/year). Both atmospheric deposition and surface water inflow was found to be important input pathways. There was a positive correlation between the input of most perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids via atmospheric deposition and global radiation and between the input via surface water inflow and catchment area. These findings highlight the importance of atmospheric oxidation of volatile precursor compounds for contamination in surface waters.

TI Long-term surface water trends and relationship with open water
   evaporation losses in the Namoi catchment, Australia
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB Economic pressures on natural resources have led to a modification of natural surface water patterns. This has affected the hydrologic cycle at a global scale with multiple environmental and socioeconomic implications. This study evaluates long-term trends in surface water occurrence and related climate variables in a large agricultural catchment of Australia to understand trends in evaporative water losses from open water bodies. Surface water detection was based on a supervised classification of Landsat images between 1988 and 2018 to obtain inundation and surface water frequencies across the catchment, which were compared with other surface water products. Climate trends were based on monthly SILO gridded datasets. Open water evaporation was estimated using the FAO56 methodology and compared with the Penman-Monteith-Leuning Evapotranspiration V2 (PML_V2) product. Evaporation trends were analysed using the Mann Kendall (MK) test and the Sen's slope (SS). Generally, open water frequencies showed significant negative trends, though these varied spatially. The number of dams, on the other hand, had an increasing trend. Temperatures are increasing in the catchment, while rainfall and relative humidity are decreasing, resulting in an overall positive trend for reference evapotranspiration (ETr) across 90% of the catchment. Even though ETr and evaporation per unit area of water show positive trends, lumped open water evaporation showed a negative trend, possibly associated with an average decrease in surface water frequencies. Annual evaporative losses averaged 201.9 GL, exceeding annual total account usage of surface water in the catchment. All the studied changes imply a loss of blue and green water in the catchment, and provide evidence of an overall intensification of the hydrologic cycle as predicted under climate change.

TI Surface water characteristics in NCEP global spectral model and
   reanalysis
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
AB Characteristics of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis surface water budget are compared to the surface water budget characteristics in a long-term simulation with the NCEP global spectral model (GSM) used in the reanalysis. There are many geographic similarities. There are a few differences though, mainly because the reanalysis has a source (artificial) of water from a seasonally varying damping (forcing) term. Because the GSM does not have this (forcing) term, the GSM surface becomes dryer and ultimately has decreased land evaporation and precipitation. Since evaporation variations are strongly related to surface: air and skin temperature variations, this decreased GSM surface water is also associated with increased land temperature. However, the GSM surface water variability is greater because the reanalysis time constant (60 days) used to damp (force) the surface water back to the assumed climatology is shorter than characteristic land surface parameterization hydrologic times, which are of the order of 6 months. In agreement with the decreased surface water variability, the reanalysis evaporation variability is also less than the evaporation variability in the GSM. This artificial time constraint may be a reason that the reanalysis temperature predictability by surface water is less than the demonstrated GSM predictability.

TI Occurrence and mass loads of biocides in plastic debris from the Pearl
   River system, South China
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Chemical pollution in the plastic debris is an increasing global concern as most pollutants might transfer from the environment to living organisms via plastic debris. In this study, biocides in the plastic debris floating on the surface water of the Pearl River system were investigated. The abundances of large plastic debris and microplastics in the surface water were 0.07 +/- 0.13 and 0.94 +/- 1.87 items/m(3), respectively. Totally, 15 and 16 out of 19 biocides were detected in the large plastic debris and microplastics, with the concentration of each biocide in the ranges of 22.6-2460 ng/g and 16.9-2890 ng/g, respectively. Meanwhile, the concentration ranges of the detected biocides were 0.01-215 ng/L in surface water. Triclosan, triclocarban, methylparaben, and N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET) were the frequently detected compounds in the plastic samples and surface water. The partition coefficients (K-d) of biocides between the plastic debris and surface water showed a weak positive correlation with K-ow values. Biocides were also detected on the natural floats (tree leaves and branches) at concentrations of 13.7 -786 ng/g. The annual mass load of biocides in plastic debris at each site was up to 265 g/y, thereby suggesting that plastic debris might be an important carrier for the emerging contaminants, such as biocides.

   Basin, northwest China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB This study investigated the geochemical processes and the suitability for irrigation purposes of surface water and groundwater in the Yarkant River Basin, northwest China. The results showed that the surface water was moderately alkaline and neutral to slightly alkaline in the groundwater. The mean values for most ions in the groundwater were higher than those in the surface water. Geochemical method and hydrogen and oxygen isotope revealed that hydrochemical were mainly affected by dissolved evaporite minerals, ion exchange processes, and anthropogenic activities. Still, the geochemical processes of in surface water and groundwater were different. Additionally, three and four factors were extracted by factor analyses of surface water and groundwater, respectively, which distinguished the hydrochemical from natural origins and anthropogenic activities in more detail. The surface water and some groundwater in the south of the study area were suitable for irrigation processes. However, many groundwaters in the north were unsuitable for irrigation, because of their high sodium levels and salinity. The study results provide a theoretical basis for the sustainable utilization of regional water resources.

TI Surface Water Extraction From Landsat 8 OLI Imagery Using the LBV
   Transformation
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE
   SENSING
AB Surface water extraction from remote sensing images is crucial for monitoring water resources and studying global environmental change. This study introduced amethod for surface water extraction based on the LBV transformation (WE-LBV) from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. To avoid inadequate or redundant utilization of remote sensing data, input band combinations were selected using the band index method, and the LBV transformation equations for OLI images were subsequently derived. Characteristics of water and nonwater pixels were investigated after the LBV transformation. The established extraction rule stated that pixels should be classified as water if the B value is larger than the V value. For validation, the WE-LBV was used to extract water pixels from OLI images covering different water types and outside conditions and compared with other water indices on the global scale. Results showed that the producer accuracy (95.75%) and user accuracy (99.15%) of the WE-LBV were more stable and its overall accuracy (98.02%) and Kappa coefficient (0.9582) were higher than those of other methods. The WE-LBV classified shallow water and shadow pixels accurately, whereas other methods had problems. Water pixels with different colors and mixed pixels with water percentage higher than 80% could be extracted by the WE-LBV effectively. The WE-LBV did not require manually selected threshold, thus avoiding the effect of subjective human factors. Therefore, the WE-LBV is proposed as an accurate, simple, and robust method for surface water extraction, especially in situations when surface water needs to be identified in bulk automatically and accurately.

TI Measuring methods for groundwater - surface water interactions: a review
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB Interactions between groundwater and surface water play a fundamental role in the functioning of riparian ecosystems. In the context of sustainable river basin management it is crucial to understand and quantify exchange processes between groundwater and surface water. Numerous well-known methods exist for parameter estimation and process identification in aquifers and surface waters. Only in recent years has the transition zone become a subject of major research interest; thus, the need has evolved for appropriate methods applicable in this zone. This article provides an overview of the methods that are currently applied and described in the literature for estimating fluxes at the groundwater - surface water interface. Considerations for choosing appropriate methods are given including spatial and temporal scales, uncertainties, and limitations in application. It is concluded that a multi-scale approach combining multiple measuring methods may considerably constrain estimates of fluxes between groundwater and surface water.

TI Determination of groundwater recharge mechanisms using stable isotopes
   in small watersheds of the Loess Plateau, China
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Water sustainability is a major challenge on the Loess Plateau of China, since the drying of soil and loss of surface water is threatening regional water security. Fundamental to effective water management is an understanding of groundwater recharge mechanisms. Based on a time series of stable isotopes data for precipitation, surface water and groundwater, the groundwater recharge ratios and water transmission times were quantitatively identified for the studied region. The results showed that groundwater discharge to surface water was a common phenomenon during the dry and wet seasons. However, groundwater could also be recharged by precipitation and surface water during specific months when experiencing large precipitation events. Over shorter time scales (<1 year), groundwater was mainly recharged by surface water, while the groundwater recharge ratio from rainfall during the wet season was higher than that from melting snow during the dry season. Over longer time scales (>1 year), precipitation was the primary recharge source of groundwater in small watersheds due to the general flow direction of groundwater to surface water. Groundwater recharge by precipitation mostly occurred through a combination of piston flow and preferential flow, where preferential flow was the primary recharge mechanism for groundwater replenished by precipitation in this region. Surface water could quickly recharge groundwater by lateral flow through fractures in the aquifer and vertical piston flow. These findings could, therefore, be used to provide a reference for the utilization and protection of groundwater resources in the small watersheds of the loess hilly regions of the Loess Plateau.

TI Conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water for paddy rice
   irrigation in Sanjiang plain, North-East China
SO IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
AB Most of the paddy rice in the Sanjiang Plain is irrigated with groundwater. In recent years the water requirement has been increasing with the rapid spread of paddy fields, while the groundwater table is constantly falling. In order to maintain the sustainable development of water resources in the long term, comprehensive measures, including conjunctive use of surface and groundwater and water-saving practices, should be jointly applied. To investigate these comprehensive measures, a study on the conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water for paddy rice irrigation has been ongoing since 2014. This paper presents water management scenarios based on the study by adopting various water-saving irrigation technologies and measures, volume of reused water, and application of groundwater and surface water. A semi-distributed water balance model was developed to simulate the water cycle at irrigation district level in order to analyse water productivity and groundwater dynamic response to various scenarios. Based on this study, reasonable water use modes under different hydrological years are proposed. These modes show how and when to use groundwater, surface water and return flow. Groundwater and surface water should be conjunctively used with groundwater as the main source for irrigation, surface water as an auxiliary source and reused water as a supplementary source.

TI Swimming Behavior of Daphnia magna Is Altered by Pesticides of Concern,
   as Components of Agricultural Surface Water and in Acute Exposures
SO BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB Simple Summary New types of pesticides are increasingly found in surface waters around the world. Little is known about how they interact in mixtures, and how these mixtures might then affect aquatic organisms at risk of exposure. We looked at how two new pesticides, chlorantraniliprole (CHL) and imidacloprid (IMI), affected a sensitive aquatic organism, Daphnia magna. We exposed Daphnia to surface waters known to be contaminated by agricultural runoff at two time points: during an extended dry period and after the first seasonal storm event. In surface waters, the concentrations of CHL, IMI, and other pesticides of concern increased after the storm event. Exposure to these waters caused Daphnia to be hypoactive, and their response to light varied with the concentration of surface water. We then exposed Daphnia to each chemical individually and then to mixtures of the two chemicals, at concentrations that occur in polluted waterways. Daphnia exposed to CHL and IMI mixtures were more active in response to light stimuli than the control group. Daphnia swimming behavior is a sensitive way to measure the biological effects of CHL, IMI, and surface waters. Pesticides with novel modes of action including neonicotinoids and anthranilic diamides are increasingly detected in global surface waters. Little is known about how these pesticides of concern interact in mixtures at environmentally relevant concentrations, a common exposure scenario in waterways impacted by pesticide pollution. We examined effects of chlorantraniliprole (CHL) and imidacloprid (IMI) on the sensitive invertebrate, Daphnia magna. Exposures were first performed using surface waters known to be contaminated by agricultural runoff. To evaluate the seasonal variation in chemical concentration and composition of surface waters, we tested surface water samples taken at two time points: during an extended dry period and after a first flush storm event. In surface waters, the concentrations of CHL, IMI, and other pesticides of concern increased after first flush, resulting in hypoactivity and dose-dependent photomotor responses. We then examined mortality and behavior following single and binary chemical mixtures of CHL and IMI. We detected inverse photomotor responses and some evidence of synergistic effects in binary mixture exposures. Taken together, this research demonstrates that CHL, IMI, and contaminated surface waters all cause abnormal swimming behavior in D. magna. Invertebrate swimming behavior is a sensitive endpoint for measuring the biological effects of environmental pesticides of concern.

AB In recent years, human being's inappropriate development and utilization on water resources, together with the influence of climate change, Chinese arid pastoral areas has suffered serious threat to the sustainable utilization of water resources and ecological security. Under the current conditions, the grassland production development way of China's pastoral areas is mainly animal husbandry industry, and irrigation water is the most widespread water use habits. Therefore, taking the Damao County as a research area, which is a typical arid pastoral area in China, this paper summarize and define the surface water resources vulnerability attribute of pastoral area, and research the content of surface water resources vulnerability from the aspects of natural vulnerability, human vulnerability and carrying vulnerability. And then the corresponding surface water resources vulnerability assessment index system of arid pastoral areas can be set up, the results of the study show that the vulnerability performance of Damao County is obvious, from the view of vulnerability's spatial distribution, the northern and western areas are much more sensitive than other areas. What's more, the research results also can tell us that the vulnerability contribution of surface water resources on Damao County from high to low in turn is natural vulnerability, human vulnerability, carrying vulnerability.

TI Twenty-first century molecular methods for analyzing antimicrobial
   resistance in surface waters to support One Health assessments
SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGICAL METHODS
AB Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the environment is a growing global health concern, especially the dissemination of AMR into surface waters due to human and agricultural inputs. Within recent years, research has focused on trying to understand the impact of AMR in surface waters on human, agricultural and ecological health (One Health). While surface water quality assessments and surveillance of AMR have historically utilized culture-based methods, culturing bacteria has limitations due to difficulty in isolating environmental bacteria and the need for a priori information about the bacteria for selective isolation. The use of molecular techniques to analyze AMR at the genetic level has helped to overcome the difficulties with culture-based techniques since they do not require advance knowledge of the bacterial population and can analyze uncultivable environmental bacteria. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of common contemporary molecular methods available for analyzing AMR in surface waters, which include high throughput real-time polymerase chain reaction (HTqPCR), metagenomics, and whole genome sequencing. This review will also feature how these methods may provide information on human and animal health risks. HT-qPCR works at the nanoliter scale, requires only a small amount of DNA, and can analyze numerous gene targets simultaneously, but may lack in analytical sensitivity and the ability to optimize individual assays compared to conventional qPCR. Metagenomics offers more detailed genomic information and taxonomic resolution than PCR by sequencing all the microbial genomes within a sample. Its open format allows for the discovery of new antibiotic resistance genes; however, the quantity of DNA necessary for this technique can be a limiting factor for surface water samples that typically have low numbers of bacteria per sample volume. Whole genome sequencing provides the complete genomic profile of a single environmental isolate and can identify all genetic elements that may confer AMR. However, a main disadvantage of this technique is that it only provides information about one bacterial isolate and is challenging to utilize for community analysis. While these contemporary techniques can quickly provide a vast array of information about AMR in surface waters, one technique does not fully characterize AMR nor its potential risks to human, animal, or ecological health. Rather, a combination of techniques (including both molecular- and culture-based) are necessary to fully understand AMR in surface waters from a One Health perspective.

TI Assessing long-term urban surface water changes using multi-year
   satellite images: A tale of two cities, Dhaka and Hong Kong
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Water is a fundamental component of an urban environment. Management of water resources is important to facilitate a liveable environment and urban sustainability. Several factors affect water resources, including urbanization, climate change and seasons. Moreover, the nature of urban expansion and unsustainable water management practices have been associated with water scarcity, loss of biodiversity and increase of flood risk. Knowledge of the changes in urban surface water in relation to changes in seasons, land covers, anthropogenic activities, and topographical characteristics are important for managing watersheds and urban planning, and developing adaptation strategies to address environmental challenges posed by urbanization. However, existing studies rarely consider all the above factors when monitoring surface water changes in the urban environment. To address this problem, this study uses satellite images from multiple seasons and years, and assess the changes in surface water in relation to changes of several important factors, e.g., seasons, urbanization, land cover and topography. Moreover, this study applies advanced geostatistical tools to assess the local relationship between changes in surface water and the driving factors, and compares the findings in two cities Dhaka (Bangladesh) and Hong Kong with a large contrast in many aspects. First, seasonal influence in the distribution of water area is evaluated. Second, land cover classifications are assigned, and then the contingency matrix and decadal maps are formulated to investigate and evaluate the influence of urbanization on the occurrence and transitions in surface water. Third, an advanced geostatistical regression model is used to investigate the spatially varying relationships for change in surface water in relation to change in other land covers and topography. The investigations confirm that the temporal and seasonal variation, and urbanization induced land cover changes largely affect surface water. In addition, topography influences the nature of the city's expansion, which in turn entails the changes in surface water. The flat terrain of Dhaka facilitates the easy invasion of water bodies and horizontal expansion, in contrast, the steep terrain of Hong Kong prohibits horizontal expansion thus it's surface water is more stable than Dhaka.

TI Conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater in irrigation districts
   in China
SO IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
AB In China, irrigation plays a significant role in guaranteeing national food security. However, with the development of society and the economy, water resources have become increasingly short and the conflict between water supply and requirement is worsening in irrigation districts. How to optimize and allocate the limited water resources has become a research focus. Combining groundwater and surface water for agricultural irrigation is an effective approach to solve the problems. It is helpful to regulate and utilize the limited water resources more reasonably by conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater. It is also significant in protecting the environment and promoting sustainable development of irrigation districts. In this paper, the definition, principles and advantages of conjunctive use of surface and groundwater are introduced. Then related research is discussed from the perspectives of the research objectives, computing model and methodology. Study of the model on conjunctive use of surface and groundwater in irrigation districts is of great practical significance for the optimal allocation of water, the improvement of water resources utilization efficiency and the economic benefit of irrigated areas.

TI Human alteration of global surface water storage variability
SO NATURE
AB Knowing the extent of human influence on the global hydrological cycle is essential for the sustainability of freshwater resources on Earth(1,2). However, a lack of water level observations for the world's ponds, lakes and reservoirs has limited the quantification of human-managed (reservoir) changes in surface water storage compared to its natural variability(3). The global storage variability in surface water bodies and the extent to which it is altered by humans therefore remain unknown. Here we show that 57 per cent of the Earth's seasonal surface water storage variability occurs in human-managed reservoirs. Using measurements from NASA's ICESat-2 satellite laser altimeter, which was launched in late 2018, we assemble an extensive global water level dataset that quantifies water level variability for 227,386 water bodies from October 2018 to July 2020. We find that seasonal variability in human-managed reservoirs averages 0.86 metres, whereas natural water bodies vary by only 0.22 metres. Natural variability in surface water storage is greatest in tropical basins, whereas human-managed variability is greatest in the Middle East, southern Africa and the western USA. Strong regional patterns are also found, with human influence driving 67 per cent of surface water storage variability south of 45 degrees north and nearly 100 per cent in certain arid and semi-arid regions. As economic development, population growth and climate change continue to pressure global water resources(4), our approach provides a useful baseline from which ICESat-2 and future satellite missions will be able to track human modifications to the global hydrologic cycle.

TI Diversity and community structure of bacterioplankton in surface waters
   off the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula
SO POLAR RESEARCH
AB Global climate change is significantly affecting marine life off the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, but little is known about microbial ecology in this area. The main goal of this study was to investigate the bacterioplankton community structure in surface waters using pyrosequencing and to determine factors influencing this community. Pelagibacterales and Rhodobacterales (Alphaproteobacteria), Oceanospirillales and Alteromonadales (Gammaproteobacteria), and Flavobacteriales (Bacteroidetes) were the core taxa in our samples, and the five most relatively abundant genera were Pelagibacter, Polaribacter, Octadecabacter, group HTCC2207 and Sulfitobacter. Although nutrients and chlorophyll a (chl a) contributed more to bacterioplankton community structure than water masses or depth, only 30.39% of the variance could be explained by the investigated environmental factors, as revealed by RDA and pRDA. No significant difference with respect to nutrients and chl a was observed among water masses or depth, as indicated by ANOVA. Furthermore, significant correlations among the dominant bacterial genera were more common than correlations between dominant genera and environmental factors, as revealed by Spearman analysis. We conclude that nutrients and chl a become homogeneous and that interpopulation interactions may have a central role in influencing the bacterial community structure in surface waters off the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula during the summer.

TI Additional surface-water deficit to meet global universal water
   accessibility by 2030
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Universal access to safe drinking water for all is a key target of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6. However, how water accessibility improvement impacts domestic water demand and surface-water deficit (the quantity of water demand that exceeds surface-water availability) are poorly known due to uncertainty and variability in domestic water use intensities (WUIdom). Here, we developed a data-driven model to create global gridded maps of historical and future WUIdom, constrained by 1758 survey-based records spanning 220 administrative units. The results show that water accessibility improvement dominated the growth in WUIdom over the period 1990-2015, particularly in developing and least-developed economies. Achieving universal water accessibility by 2030 may lead to an additional growth in global mean WUIdom by 21.7 L capita 1 day(-1). Additional 88.3 million people, from 14 developing countries and 9 least-developed countries, may move into domestic surface-water deficit. Another 16% of global irrigated areas would be at risk of irrigation surface-water deficit mainly in South Asia, Central Asia, and North Africa. These findings imply the need of spatially flexible set of actions to achieve global universal water accessibility by 2030 without worsening surface-water deficit.

TI SURFACE WATER QUALITY ASSESSMENT USING ELECTROANALYTICAL METHODS AND
   INDUCTIVELY COUPLED PLASMA MASS SPECTROMETRY (ICP-MS)
SO ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB Heavy metals can reach into surface water mainly as a result of domestic and industrial activities. Copper, zinc, manganese, iron, etc. are just a few examples of heavy metals that are naturally present in soil and water, some are considered indispensable for life but, in high concentrations may become toxic. If external factors (domestic and industrial activities) interfere with the environment, the level of heavy metals naturally contained in the surface water is also affected and thus its toxicity increases. However, in low concentrations, some elements like cadmium, mercury, lead, nickel, and chromium are considered also toxic and therefore are included in a different category of heavy metals. In this respect, the present inquiry aims to provide a surface water-quality data set by using consistent sampling methods and analysis, correlated with statistical results. The present research topic aimed to assess the degree of pollution (and implicitly the surface water quality) of the Ialomita River during October-November 2021, depending on the variation of climatic parameters, and the impact of anthropogenic and industrial activity in the studied area. In this regard, 16 water samples were collected in the above-mentioned time interval, which were subsequently investigated using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), for the assessment of the content of heavy metals, as well as measuring equipment for determination of indicators such as: pH, resistivity, total dissolved solid, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, salinity, total and free chlorine, turbidity. The average concentrations of heavy metals were correlated with physicochemical indicators. The ultimate goal of the research is to create a bridge by comparison with the results obtained in a similar study, conducted in the period 2015-2016. The results indicate that the occurrence of metals in high concentrations may pose a detrimental health risk to the exposed population. In addition, these results can be relevant for the improvement of integrated management measures for the river's surface water at the national level to attain the goals provided in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

TI Assessment of surface water and groundwater interaction using
   hydrogeology, hydrochemical and isotopic constituents in the Imphal
   river basin, Northeast India
SO GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The surface water and groundwater interaction in the Imphal River Basin in Northeast India using hydrogeology, hydrochemical and isotopic constituents has examined to elucidate hydrochemical evolution, surface water and groundwater mixing and recharge condition. Groundwater is characterized by Ca2+-Cl--HCO3- facies while surface water exhibits Ca2+-Cl- type. Surface water prevailed the intermediate stage of chemical evolution while groundwater characterizes the late stage of chemical evolution. Analysis of flow net combined with hydrogeologic sections revealed significant relationship of surface water and groundwater in the basin. The upper and lower reaches are characterized by contour heads showing an upstream pointing curvature due to depression induced by groundwater discharge where contour lines cross a gaining stream. The middle reach is marked by contour curvature pointing downstream owing to mounding induced by groundwater recharge where it crosses a losing stream. Groundwater shows markedly depleted isotopic composition than surface water. Both surface water and groundwater fall below Global Meteoric Water Line and Local Meteoric Water Line indicating the source of water through infiltration of modern precipitation. The slope of the evaporation line and the original composition of water are identified as 4.92 and -6.58 parts per thousand and -42.17 parts per thousand, respectively. Isotopic d-excess values revealed isotopic composition of semi-arid climate.

TI Effects of Meteorological Parameters on Surface Water Loss in Burdur
   Lake, Turkey over 34 Years Landsat Google Earth Engine Time-Series
SO LAND
AB The current work aims to examine the effect of meteorological parameters as well as the temporal variation on the Burdur Lake surface water body areas in Turkey. The data for the surface area of Burdur Lake was collected over 34 years between 1984 and 2019 by Google Earth Engine. The seasonal variation in the water bodies area was collected using our proposed extraction method and 570 Landsat images. The reduction in the total area of the lake was observed between 206.6 km(2) in 1984 to 125.5 km(2) in 2019. The vegetation cover and meteorological parameters collected that affect the observed variation of surface water bodies for the same area include precipitation, evapotranspiration, albedo, radiation, and temperature. The selected meteorological variables influence the reduction in lake area directly during various seasons. Correlations showed a strong positive or negative significant relationship between the reduction and the selected meteorological variables. A factor analysis provided three components that explain 82.15% of the total variation in the data. The data provide valuable references for decision makers to develop sustainable agriculture and industrial water use policies to preserve water resources as well as cope with potential climate changes.

TI Comparison of characteristics, water quality and health risk assessment
   of trace elements in surface water and groundwater in China
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB Water quality is closely associated with human health and socio-economic sustainable development. With the increasingly intensive anthropogenic activities, pollutants especially trace elements, enter water aquatic system and cause harm to humans. This study conducted the first systematic comparison on the pollution status of surface water and groundwater in China. Water quality and health risk assessment of 12 trace elements were evaluated according to the water quality index (WQI), hazard quotient (HQ), hazard index (HI), and carcinogenic risk (CR). The results showed that the average values of trace elements in the majority of surface water were higher than those in groundwater. The WQI values demonstrated that 86.02% of surface water and 83.11% of groundwater were suitable for drinking water. Arsenic served as the predominant pollutant and contributed significantly to cause the non-carcinogenic risk on human health in both surface water and groundwater, children were more vulnerable to the adverse effects than adults. In surface water, the priority non-carcinogenic risk sites were mainly distributed in Anning River, Taizi River, Middle reaches of Huai River and Jilin section of Songhua River. For groundwater, the high-risk sites were located in Huhhot Basin, Kuitun, Jianghan Plain, Datong Basin and Yucheng County. Arsenic posed potential carcinogenic risk to local resident in some water sites, and it presented higher in groundwater than surface water. More concerns should be paid on Songhua, Yangtze and Huai River Basins, in addition, Pearl, Southeast Coastal, Southwest and Northwest River Basins still need attention. The future work should be carried out more extensive range of the water sites and long-term monitoring in China. In particular, more attention should be dedicated to assess high As water bodies.

AB It is widely accepted that groundwater and surface water are not isolated components of the catchment water balance and that their interaction is important to stream ecology, water quality and water quantity. A quantitative understanding of the interaction between surface water and groundwater is therefore crucial for sustainable management of water resources. Physically based models can help to conceptualize and understand these interactions. The paper presents two examples of how such models can help to improve our understanding and therefore our management strategies. Some final conclusions on the importance of physically based modeling in understanding surface water groundwater interactions are drawn.

TI Impact of grain virtual water flow on surface water and groundwater in
   China
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
AB Virtual water flow can alleviate the pressure of regional water resources. Differences in water resources endowment and industrial structure among regions cause regional differences in water use in China. Water use in agriculture, especially irrigation, heavily relies on both surface water and groundwater. Virtual water flow may have different influence on the utilization and exploitation of regional surface water and groundwater. However, few studies have separately investigated the impacts of virtual water transfer on them. According to virtual water theory, contribution rate and regional differences, this study evaluates the effects of virtual water flow on water resources among provinces in China. The results indicate most regions mainly rely on surface water that accounts for less than 50% of surface water supply in only four provinces, namely Hebei, Henan, Beijing, and Shanxi. In the Northern region and mainly in North China, the dependence on groundwater is very high. The total virtual water flow in China increased from 75.8 Gm(3) in 1998 to 124.6 Gm(3) in 2014 and showed a trend from the northeast and central regions to the south and western regions. Given the decrease in the scale of virtual water export, the decline of groundwater level in North China is not further aggravated. Water-saving irrigation is the main method to improve the efficiency of irrigation water use. The results of the study can aid in improving the sustainability of surface water and groundwater management in the grain production process via identifying dominant areas.

TI Spatial and temporal analysis and quantification of pollution sources of
   the surface water quality in a coastal province in Vietnam
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB The surface water quality in coastal areas may be highly vulnerable to degradation due to various pollution sources such as seawater intrusion and anthropogenic activities. The current study sought to spatially and temporally analyze and quantify pollution sources of the surface water system in the coastal province of Tra Vinh, Vietnam. A total of 600 surface water samples were taken from 30 monitoring sites distributed over 4 spatial zones. Water samples were collected in four campaigns each year during the dry and rainy seasons from 2016 to 2020 and analyzed for 10 physiochemical and biological parameters. The analyzed data were calculated for the water quality index (WQI). Two-way analysis of variance, principal component analysis/factor analysis (PCA/FA), and multivariable regression analysis (MRA) were conducted over the whole dataset. The results showed that the WQI decreased from the inland zone to the coastal area, was greater in the river zone than in the canal zone, and was higher in the dry season than in the rainy season. The PCA/FA revealed that surface water quality was affected by at least 4 main pollution sources, including agricultural production, seawater intrusion, residential activities, and mixed sources. MRA revealed that these pollution sources explained 68.3%, 12.8%, 7.0%, and 2.7% of the total variance of the WQI, respectively. In summary, the surface water quality in the study area significantly changed spatially and temporally, depending on four pollution sources, which need to be managed properly for a better environment and sustainable development.

TI Perfluorooctane Sulfonate in US Ambient Surface Waters: A Review of
   Occurrence in Aquatic Environments and Comparison to Global
   Concentrations
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is one of the dominant perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) detected in aquatic ecosystems. It has been used in a wide range of industrial and consumer products for decades. The unique properties of PFOS, including its stability and resistance to degradation, have made it highly persistent in the aquatic environment. Because of its persistence, potential toxicity, and occurrence in aquatic ecosystems, interest in PFOS has increased in recent decades. Despite this interest, current information on the environmental distribution of PFOS in ambient surface waters of the United States is fairly limited. This critical review summarizes the currently available literature on PFOS occurrence in surface waters across the United States and highlights existing data gaps. Available data are largely from a handful of study areas with known PFAS manufacturing or industrial uses, with much of the data collected from freshwater systems in eastern states and the upper Midwest. Measured PFOS concentrations in surface waters vary widely, over 8 orders of magnitude, with the highest concentrations occurring downstream from manufacturing and industrial use plants, areas near aqueous film-forming foam-use sites, and sites where PFOS precursors were used in textile treatment. Non-point source-related occurrences are highest near urbanized areas with high population densities. Current data illustrate the occurrence of PFOS in surface waters across multiple US states. Additional data are needed to better understand PFOS occurrence in US aquatic ecosystems, particularly in estuarine and marine systems and where monitoring data are not available (e.g., southwestern, central, and western United States). Additional PFOS occurrence data would provide valuable information on potential spatial and temporal variability in surface waters and possible risks posed to aquatic ecosystems.

TI Assessing the influence of climate change and inter-basin water
   diversion on Haihe River basin, eastern China: a coupled model approach
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB The modeling of changes in surface water and groundwater in the areas of inter-basin water diversion projects is quite difficult because surface water and groundwater models are run separately most of the time and the lack of sufficient data limits the application of complex surface-water/groundwater coupling models based on physical laws, especially for developing countries. In this study, a distributed surface-water and groundwater coupling model, named the distributed time variant gain model-groundwater model (DTVGM-GWM), was used to assess the influence of climate change and inter-basin water diversion on a watershed hydrological cycle. The DTVGM-GWM model can reflect the interaction processes of surface water and groundwater at basin scale. The model was applied to the Haihe River Basin (HRB) in eastern China. The possible influences of climate change and the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) on surface water and groundwater in the HRB were analyzed under various scenarios. The results showed that the newly constructed model DTVGM-GWM can reasonably simulate the surface and river runoff, and describe the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of groundwater level, groundwater storage and phreatic recharge. The prediction results under different scenarios showed a decline in annual groundwater exploitation and also runoff in the HRB, while an increase of groundwater storage and groundwater level after the SNWDP's operation. Additionally, as the project also addresses future scenarios, a slight increase is predicted in the actual evapotranspiration, soil water content and phreatic recharge. This study provides valuable insights for developing sustainable groundwater management options for the HRB.

TI The SWOT Mission and Its Capabilities for Land Hydrology
SO SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
AB Surface water storage and fluxes in rivers, lakes, reservoirs and wetlands are currently poorly observed at the global scale, even though they represent major components of the water cycle and deeply impact human societies. In situ networks are heterogeneously distributed in space, and many river basins and most lakes-especially in the developing world and in sparsely populated regions-remain unmonitored. Satellite remote sensing has provided useful complementary observations, but no past or current satellite mission has yet been specifically designed to observe, at the global scale, surface water storage change and fluxes. This is the purpose of the planned Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission. SWOT is a collaboration between the (US) National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Centre National d'A parts per thousand tudes Spatiales (the French Spatial Agency), the Canadian Space Agency and the United Kingdom Space Agency, with launch planned in late 2020. SWOT is both a continental hydrology and oceanography mission. However, only the hydrology capabilities of SWOT are discussed here. After a description of the SWOT mission requirements and measurement capabilities, we review the SWOT-related studies concerning land hydrology published to date. Beginning in 2007, studies demonstrated the benefits of SWOT data for river hydrology, both through discharge estimation directly from SWOT measurements and through assimilation of SWOT data into hydrodynamic and hydrology models. A smaller number of studies have also addressed methods for computation of lake and reservoir storage change or have quantified improvements expected from SWOT compared with current knowledge of lake water storage variability. We also briefly review other land hydrology capabilities of SWOT, including those related to transboundary river basins, human water withdrawals and wetland environments. Finally, we discuss additional studies needed before and after the launch of the mission, along with perspectives on a potential successor to SWOT.

TI Surface Water Dynamics from Space: A Round Robin Intercomparison of
   Using Optical and SAR High-Resolution Satellite Observations for
   Regional Surface Water Detection
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Climate change, increasing population and changes in land use are all rapidly driving the need to be able to better understand surface water dynamics. The targets set by the United Nations under Sustainable Development Goal 6 in relation to freshwater ecosystems also make accurate surface water monitoring increasingly vital. However, the last decades have seen a steady decline in in situ hydrological monitoring and the availability of the growing volume of environmental data from free and open satellite systems is increasingly being recognized as an essential tool for largescale monitoring of water resources. The scientific literature holds many promising studies on satellite-based surface-water mapping, but a systematic evaluation has been lacking. Therefore, a round robin exercise was organized to conduct an intercomparison of 14 different satellite-based approaches for monitoring inland surface dynamics with Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 imagery. The objective was to achieve a better understanding of the pros and cons of different sensors and models for surface water detection and monitoring. Results indicate that, while using a single sensor approach (applying either optical or radar satellite data) can provide comprehensive results for very specific localities, a dual sensor approach (combining data from both optical and radar satellites) is the most effective way to undertake largescale national and regional surface water mapping across bioclimatic gradients.

TI Groundwater impacts on surface water quality and nutrient loads in
   lowland polder catchments: monitoring the greater Amsterdam area
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB The Amsterdam area, a highly manipulated delta area formed by polders and reclaimed lakes, struggles with high nutrient levels in its surface water system. The polders receive spatially and temporally variable amounts of water and nutrients via surface runoff, groundwater seepage, sewer leakage, and via water inlets from upstream polders. Diffuse anthropogenic sources, such as manure and fertiliser use and atmospheric deposition, add to the water quality problems in the polders. The major nutrient sources and pathways have not yet been clarified due to the complex hydrological system in lowland catchments with both urban and agricultural areas. In this study, the spatial variability of the groundwater seepage impact was identified by exploiting the dense groundwater and surface water monitoring networks in Amsterdam and its surrounding polders. A total of 25 variables (concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), NH4, NO3, HCO3, SO4, Ca, and Cl in surface water and groundwater, N and P agricultural inputs, seepage rate, elevation, land-use, and soil type) for 144 polders were analysed statistically and interpreted in relation to sources, transport mechanisms, and pathways. The results imply that groundwater is a large source of nutrients in the greater Amsterdam mixed urban-agricultural catchments. The groundwater nutrient concentrations exceeded the surface water environmental quality standards (EQSs) in 93% of the polders for TP and in 91% for TN. Groundwater outflow into the polders thus adds to nutrient levels in the surface water. High correlations (R-2 up to 0.88) between solutes in groundwater and surface water, together with the close similarities in their spatial patterns, confirmed the large impact of groundwater on surface water chemistry, especially in the polders that have high seepage rates. Our analysis indicates that the elevated nutrient and bicarbonate concentrations in the groundwater seepage originate from the decomposition of organic matter in subsurface sediments coupled to sulfate reduction and possibly methanogenesis. The large loads of nutrient-rich groundwater seepage into the deepest polders indirectly affect surface water quality in the surrounding area, because excess water from the deep polders is pumped out and used to supply water to the surrounding infiltrating polders in dry periods. The study shows the importance of the connection between groundwater and surface water nutrient chemistry in the greater Amsterdam area. We expect that taking account of groundwater-surface water interaction is also important in other subsiding and urbanising deltas around the world, where water is managed intensively in order to enable agricultural productivity and achieve water-sustainable cities.

TI Transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 in the watershed triggered by domestic
   wastewater discharge
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The outbreak of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has already become an unprecedented global pandemic. However, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, especially the protected SARS-CoV-2 RNA (pRNA) with infectious particles in waterways, is still largely unexplored. In this study, we developed a model to estimate SARS-CoV-2 transmission from the risk source in the excretion of patients to the final exposure in surface water. The model simulated the spatial and temporal distribution of the viral pRNA concentrations in the surface water of the Elbe watershed from March 2020 to January 2021. The results show that the WW1Ps with the maximum capacity of >10,000 population equivalents were responsible for 95% of the viral load discharged into the surface water. We estimated the pRNA concentrations in surface water to be 1.33 x 10(2) copies.L-1 on average in the watershed based on the model simulation on viral transmission. It had considerable variations in spatial and temporal scales, which are dominantly controlled by epidemic situations and virus transport with decay in water, respectively. A quantitative microbial risk assessment was conducted to estimate the viral infection probability from surface water ingestion with consideration of the influence of toilet usage frequency and gender/age population groups. All the infection probabilities in the study period were lower than the reference risk levels of 10 4 and 10(-5). The individuals aged 15-34 years had the highest infection probability of 4.86 x 10(-9) on average from surface water ingestion during swimming activities. The data provided herein suggest that the low pRNA concentrations and infection probability reflected that the waterways were unlikely to be a significant transmission route for SARS-CoV-2.

TI ASSESING THE OPORTUNITIES OF DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE DRAINAGE SYSTEMS IN
   ROMANIA
SO AGROLIFE SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL
AB Rainfall and surface water runoff are valuable resources, and this should be reflected in the way it is managed and used in our cities and towns in Romania. It can provide beauty, enhance biodiversity, improve buildings, places, and spaces. Also, it helps making them more adaptive and resilient to climate change, which is one of the biggest challenges in the world. The SuDS philosophy is about maximising the benefits and minimising the negative impacts of surface water runoff from developed areas. Moreover, SuDS are designed to manage the flood and pollution risks resulting from urban runoff but also to contribute wherever possible to environmental enhancement and place making. With this in mind, the multi functionality and multiple benefits of SuDS should always be considered. Going forward, in most of the towns and cities there are opportunities to better manage surface water - replacing the old systems that discharge rain and runoff to the drains and sewers with new ones which capture rain, manage surface water runoff, and deliver multiple benefits.

TI Impacts of Climate Change and Intensive Lesser Snow Goose (Chen
   caerulescens caerulescens) Activity on Surface Water in High Arctic Pond
   Complexes
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Rapid increases in air temperature in Arctic and subarctic regions are driving significant changes to surface waters. These changes and their impacts are not well understood in sensitive high-Arctic ecosystems. This study explores changes in surface water in the high Arctic pond complexes of western Banks Island, Northwest Territories. Landsat imagery (1985-2015) was used to detect sub-pixel trends in surface water. Comparison of higher resolution aerial photographs (1958) and satellite imagery (2014) quantified changes in the size and distribution of waterbodies. Field sampling investigated factors contributing to the observed changes. The impact of expanding lesser snow goose populations and other biotic or abiotic factors on observed changes in surface water were also investigated using an information theoretic model selection approach. Our analyses show that the pond complexes of western Banks Island lost 7.9% of the surface water that existed in 1985. Drying disproportionately impacted smaller sized waterbodies, indicating that climate is the main driver. Model selection showed that intensive occupation by lesser snow geese was associated with more extensive drying and draining of waterbodies and suggests this intensive habitat use may reduce the resilience of pond complexes to climate warming. Changes in surface water are likely altering permafrost, vegetation, and the utility of these areas for animals and local land-users, and should be investigated further.

TI History of Urban Water Use in Tokyo : Focusing on Surface Water and
   Groundwater as Water Sources
SO JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-CHIGAKU ZASSHI
AB The purpose of this study is to review the history of urban water use in Tokyo focusing on two water sources: surface water and groundwater. First, the following four matters are picked up chronologically: expansion of metropolitan waterworks, enhancement of surface water resources, progress of land subsidence, and groundwater pumping. Second, the change of ground- water use and current conservation policies are clarified for some municipalities. Finally, sustainability of urban water use is discussed.
   Originally, the water source of metropolitan waterworks was surface water. With increased water demand, the waterworks developed surface water resources in areas remote from Tokyo. Despite increased water demand, groundwater pumping was restricted because of serious land subsidence. Industrial water shifted the water source from groundwater to surface water with the construction of industrial waterworks. On the other hand, groundwater use as residential water has been partially maintained in the Tama Region, western Tokyo. Municipalities in the Tama Region promote policies to maintain groundwater use and recharge.
   For sustainable urban water use, efforts both to avoid a further increase of water demand and to maintain local groundwater resources are necessary. Moreover, in terms of water security at the time of a disaster or water shortage, a sustainable urban water supply system should include both an extensive water supply system and a local system of water supply.

TI Surface-Water-Level Changes During 2003-2019 in Australia Revealed by
   ICESat/ICESat-2 Altimetry and Landsat Imagery
SO IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
AB Surface-water-level changes reflect Earth's water resource variations (e.g., trends and fluctuations) and they are helpful to understand potential drivers (e.g., climate change and human activities). Currently, Australia is facing serious water crisis owing to rainfall shortage and climate change, and national-scale data set on surface-water-level changes is required for supporting sustainable water resource management. Here, we used all Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM)+/Operational Land Imager (OLI) data available on Google Earth Engine to obtain annual surface water during 2003-2019 and produced 1506 boundaries of water bodies with areas greater than 1 km2 across Australia. The produced surface water map in Australia is more accurate than the existing global lake databases (e.g., the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database), which can be downloaded for free. Then, 52 water bodies (lakes and reservoirs) with areas larger than 1 km(2) and available Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat/ICESat-2) data for more than 5 years were combined to estimate trends in surface water levels in Australia. Across Australia, from 2003 to 2019, the area-weighted mean of water level change rates is -0.046 m/year with 17 lakes (32.7%) with increasing water levels and 35 lakes (67.3%) decreasing with water levels. In detail, the largest lakes (>100 km(2)) dominate the total change trend and most of the largest lakes underwent decreasing trend (-0.046 m/year), whereas the mean water levels of small lakes (<10 km(2)) increased in the past 17 years. In situ water levels of three typical lakes/reservoirs were used to validate our estimation results, which exhibited a very good agreement (R-2 = 0.98).

TI Simulating Potential Weekly Stream and Pond Water Available for
   Irrigation in the Big Sunflower River Watershed of Mississippi Delta
SO WATER
AB Groundwater storage and level have declined rapidly in the Big Sunflower River Watershed (BSRW) of Mississippi Delta in recent years. Farmers in this region are beginning to save groundwater resources by increasing surface water usage for agricultural irrigation. In this study, we estimated the weekly amount of surface water available in ponds and streams, determined if the weekly surface water resources are sufficient for major crop irrigation demand, and assessed how much surface water can replace groundwater for agriculture irrigation in the BSRW. The SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model was employed to simulate the weekly water resources for 23 sub-basins from the BSRW. Results showed that weekly stream water resources (SWR), stream evaporation (SE) and water loss from the channel via transmission through the side and bottom of the channel (stream transmission, referred as ST) for BSRW during the growing seasons ranged from 20.4 to 29.4 mm, 7.4 to 14.4 mm, 1.6 to 4.5 mm and 1.1 to 1.6 mm, while pond water resources (PWR) and pond evaporation (PE) ranged from 1.9 to 2.1 mm and 0.3 to 0.5 mm. The value of SWR - (ST + SE) and PWR - PE were positive in all sub-basins, indicating that there are net surface water resources available in this region. The percentages of total groundwater usage for irrigation that could be replaced by surface water in each sub-basin every week of each month from May to September ranged from 10% to 87%. Our studies suggested that the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater for agriculture irrigation is a feasible method for groundwater sustainable management in the Mississippi Delta.

TI Hydrochemical characterisation of ground and surface water at
   Dortyol/Hatay/Turkey
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
AB The degradation of ground water quality due to human activities is a widespread environmental problem. Furthermore, coastal aquifers are threatened by sea water intrusion as a result of increasing water exploitation. The investigation area near Dortyol is located at the Mediterranean coast, southern Turkey, and dominated by agricultural land use. Drinking, domestic and agricultural purposes require different amounts of uncontaminated water. In this study the hydrogeological characteristics of the coastal plain were investigated. Discharge and ground water level measurements as well as geological investigations were undertaken in field in addition to anion and cation analyses of ground and surface water. The results show geological and anthropogenic influence on ground and surface water composition. In spite of a large number of wells in the coastal area sea water intrusion was not detected. With the goal of devising sustainable water use regulations, more emphasis and research needs to be directed to the long-term observation of ground and surface water quality as well as the detailed investigation of hydraulic characteristics of the local aquifer.

TI Occurrence and ecological risk assessment of PPCPs in typical inflow
   rivers of Taihu lake, China
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The occurrence and ecological risks of ten typical pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) at 12 typical inflow rivers of Taihu lake was investigated in this study. Seven out of the ten typical PPCPs targeted were detected in all the water samples and sediment samples tested. The PPCPs concentration detected were 0-94.91 ng/L for water samples and 0-18.27 ng/g for sediment samples. Sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) and erythromycin (ERY) has relatively higher concentration than other PPCPs in surface water samples, ciprofloxacin (CIP) and ofloxacin (OFX) has relatively higher concentration in the sediment samples. Inflow river-Caoqiao river has a relatively highest contamination of TN and TP, the PPCPs concentration in the river channel, estuary, lake-body also shows high value. This occurs in both the surface water and sediment sample, implied a relatively high pollution input from Caoqiao river. SMZ holds high long-term ecological risks in both surface water and sediment of almost all the tested inflow rivers of Taihu lake. Only ERY has medium short-term risks in surface water, other analyzed PPCPs hold low or insignificant short-terms risks for both surface water and sediments. This study fills the gap of PPCPs ecological risk of surface water and sediment of 12 typical inflow rivers of Taihu Lake, and revealed the importance of control sulfanilamide of the economic belt around Taihu Lake. The results of the present study are useful in providing information for PPCPs control and sustainable water management in freshwater lakes.

TI Surface water and energy budgets in the NCEP regional spectral model
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
AB Characteristics of the U.S. surface water and energy budgets in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) regional spectral model (RSM) and the driving NCEP/NCAR (NCEPR) reanalysis are compared. The RSM is similar to the global spectral model (GSM) used in the reanalyses except that it has higher resolution over a limited area. There are, however, other important differences. Besides minor parameterization differences the RSM does not have an artificial water source to maintain the surface moisture (unlike the NCEPR), and the RSM surface water dries. Although the much larger wintertime surface water difference has only a small effect on the evaporation differences and other components of the wintertime water and energy cycles, summertime effects are greater. Relative to the NCEPR the RSM develops a consistent summertime pattern of decreased surface water, precipitation, evaporation, increased sensible heating, outgoing longwave radiation, incoming solar radiation and temperature over the western Mississippi River basin and the Gulf of Mexico, south and eastern coasts. Opposite features occur over the eastern Mississippi River basin and the U.S. West in the RSM. These hydrologically and energetically consistent RSM and NCEPR spatial differences extend to interannual variations in RSM water and energy budgets, which appear to be more strongly influenced by larger interannual surface water variations than might be discerned from the NCEPR.

TI Impact of surface water extraction on water quality and ecological
   integrity in Arusha National Park, Tanzania
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB Surface water has been extracted from Arusha National Park (ANP) to meet human demand for over 30years; however, there has been no evaluation of the impact of extraction on surface water quality, budget or ecological integrity. A reduction in water availability and flow is likely to also have impacts on the distribution and space use of large mammals. To assess the surface water quality and budget, 30 water sources were measured for three months over the dry and wet seasons. Nearly 70% of water is extracted, with the complete extraction of surface water common during the dry and early wet seasons. However, extraction did not lead to a decrease in downstream water quality, but wetland plant diversity was highest in areas with no surface water extraction. Extraction also influences large mammal space use: abundance along seven transects was typically higher upstream of extraction sites, especially in the case of large herbivores. Impacts of extraction therefore include the disconnection of streams, changes in space use of large mammals, decreases in plant diversity and changes in species composition of the riparian wetlands. We therefore recommend that monitoring and evaluation of extraction as well as sustainable water use practices be introduced as a matter of urgency.

TI Application of Nitrogen and Oxygen Isotopes for Source and Fate
   Identification of Nitrate Pollution in Surface Water: A Review
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Nitrate pollution in surface water has become an environmental problem of global concern. The effective way for controlling the nitrate pollution of surface water is to identify the pollution source and reduce the input of nitrate. In recent decades, nitrogen (delta N-15) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotopes of nitrate has been used as an effective approach for identifying the source and fate of nitrate pollution in surface water. However, owing to the complexity of nitrate pollution source and the influence of isotopic fractionation, the application of this method has some limitations. In this work, we systematically discussed the fundamental principle of using nitrogen and oxygen isotopes to trace the nitrate source, the fate identification of nitrate, and the major testing techniques. Subsequently, the applications of nitrogen and oxygen isotopes for source identification of surface water were illustrated. However, there are still significant gaps in the application of the source identification and transformation mechanisms to nitrate and many research questions on these topics need to be addressed.

TI Estimating the Value of Conjunctive Water Use at a System-Level Using
   Nonlinear Programing Model
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL POLICY
AB Uncertainty and shortages of surface water supplies, as a result of global climate change and flow regulation and harvesting regimes, necessitate development of groundwater in many irrigation management areas. Groundwater can be expensive to pump, but provides a reliable supply if managed sustainably. Groundwater can be used optimally in conjunction with surface water supplies. The use of such conjunctive systems can significantly decrease the risk associated with a stochastic availability of surface water supply.
   We propose an innovative nonlinear programing model for the optimisation of profitability and productivity in an irrigation command area with conjunctive water use options. The model, rather than using exogenous yields and gross margins, uses crop water production and profit functions to endogenously determine yields and water use, and associated gross margins, respectively, for various conjunctive water use options. The model allows the estimation of the potential economic benefits of conjunctive water use and derives an optimal use of regional level land and water resources by maximising the net benefits and water productivity under various physical and economic constraints.
   The proposed model is applied to the Coleambally Irrigation Area (CIA) in south eastern Australia to explore potential economic benefit of conjunctive water use. The results show that optimal conjunctive water use can offer significant economic benefit, especially at low levels of surface water allocation and pumping cost. At lower levels of surface water allocation the results show that conjunctive water use potentially generate additional AUD 57.3 million. On the other hand, at higher levels of surface water allocation, additional benefit of conjunctive water use is AUD 9.4 million. The model could be applied to analyse the impact of escalating energy prices for groundwater dependent irrigation systems, and other irrigation systems, to maximise the potential of conjunctive water use.

TI Changes in Water Surface Area during 1989-2017 in the Huai River Basin
   using Landsat Data and Google Earth Engine
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB The dynamics of surface water play a crucial role in the hydrological cycle and are sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic activities, especially for the agricultural zone. As one of the most populous areas in China's river basins, the surface water in the Huai River Basin has significant impacts on agricultural plants, ecological balance, and socioeconomic development. However, it is unclear how water areas responded to climate change and anthropogenic water exploitation in the past decades. To understand the changes in water surface areas in the Huai River Basin, this study used the available 16,760 scenes Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI images in this region from 1989 to 2017 and processed the data on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The vegetation index and water index were used to quantify the spatiotemporal variability of the surface water area changes over the years. The major results include: (1) The maximum area, the average area, and the seasonal variation of surface water in the Huai River Basin showed a downward trend in the past 29 years, and the year-long surface water areas showed a slight upward trend; (2) the surface water area was positively correlated with precipitation (p < 0.05), but was negatively correlated with the temperature and evapotranspiration; (3) the changes of the total area of water bodies were mainly determined by the 216 larger water bodies (>10 km(2)). Understanding the variations in water body areas and the controlling factors could support the designation and implementation of sustainable water management practices in agricultural, industrial, and domestic usages.

TI Organic carbon sources and controlling processes on aquifer arsenic
   cycling in the Jianghan Plain, central China
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Groundwater arsenic contamination is a common environmental problem that threatens the health of over 100 million people globally. Apparent seasonal fluctuations in groundwater arsenic concentrations have been reported in various locations worldwide, including the Jianghan Plain, central China. This phenomenon has been attributed to shifts in redox conditions induced by seasonal incursions of surface water. However, it is not clear what processes during the incursion lead to changes in the redox conditions and what is the source of the organic carbon driving these processes. Therefore, we conducted a long-term investigation of stable carbon isotopic compositions in surface water and groundwater, as well as long-term monitoring of hydraulic gradients and geochemical compositions at the Jianghan Plain. Results indicated that a series of biogeochemical processes occurred during surface water incursion, including aerobic microbial respiration, nitrate and sulfate reduction. Groundwater arsenic was removed by adsorption on iron oxyhydroxides produced during oxidation of ferrous iron, resulting in dramatic decreases in arsenic concentrations during surface water recharge seasons. These processes were likely driven by organic carbon vertically transported from surface water and released from the surficial aquitard above 15 m. Groundwater pumping may accelerate the vertical infiltration of oxidizing recharge water and drive exogenous organic carbon to depth. Findings of this study advance the understandings of the mechanisms that cause temporal variations in groundwater As and the importance of exogenous organic carbon that may influence the temporal behavior of arsenic in groundwater.

Samples were collected from 12 lakes and analysed for 24 parameters namely temperature (T), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), turbidity (Tur), total suspended solids (TSS) and total dissolved solids (TDS), total alkalinity (TA), total hardness (TH), chloride ion (Cl-), fluoride (F-), sulphate (SO42-), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), dissolved oxygen (DO) biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium nitrogen (NH3-N), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), nitrate (NO3-) total phosphorus (TP) and available phosphorus (AP). Multivariate statistical techniques were used for the assessment of water quality. Cluster analysis (CA) was used for classification of water quality parameters and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify the sources of pollution. CA grouped all the water quality parameters in three cluster. PCA resulted in six useful components which explained 90.54% of the total variance. Based on overall study it was concluded that the sources of pollution of lakes were the use of fertilizers, storm water runoff, land development and domestic waste water discharge. Trophic state of lakes was also evaluated using Carlson's Trophic State Index (TSI).

TI Mitigating phosphorus pollution from detergents in the surface waters of
   China
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Phosphorus (P) from detergents contributes to water pollution and eutrophication. Understanding the impacts of detergent use on P inputs to surface waters and their main drivers is vital for supporting Sustainable Development Goals on clean water. This study aims to quantify past and future trends in P inputs to surface wa-ters from detergent use in China. We modify the Model to Assess River Input of Nutrient to seAs (MARINA) model to assess the effects of past policies and explore options for the future on mitigating detergents P losses in China. The total consumption of detergents tripled from 2000 to 2018. However, P inputs to surface waters from deter-gent use decreased by 35% during these years. Although P losses vary across regions, most losses occurred in rural areas. Clearly, the P-free detergent policy which was initiated in the year 2000 has been effective. Without this policy, the detergent P losses would likely have increased fourfold during 2000-2018. In the future, detergent P inputs to surface waters in China may be further reduced to very low levels (95% reduction relative to 2018) by a combination of completely P-free detergents, an increasing urbanized population connected to sewage systems, and improving P removal in sewage treatment systems. Our results enhance the understanding of P pol-lution in surface waters from detergents and, illustrate the effectiveness of measures to control detergent P losses. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI Raw water biofiltration for surface water manganese control
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Manganese (Mn) control in surface water systems is a challenge for the drinking water industry, especially through a sustainability framework. Current methods for removing manganese from surface water use strong oxidants that embed carbon and can be expensive and harmful to human health and the environment. In this study, we used a simple biofilter design to remove manganese from lake water, without conventional surface water pre-treatments. Biofilters with aerated influent removed manganese to concentrations below 10 mu g/L when receiving influent water containing > 120 mu g/L of dissolved manganese. Manganese removal was not inhibited by high iron loadings or poor ammonia removal, suggesting that removal mechanisms may differ from groundwater biofilters. Experimental biofilters also achieved lower effluent manganese concentrations than the full-scale conventional treatment process, while receiving higher manganese concentrations. This biological approach could help achieve sustainable development goals.

TI Historical Patterns of Anthropogenic Impacts on Freshwaters in the
   Berlin-Brandenburg Region
SO ERDE
AB Since humans are preferentially settling in flood plains they often influence freshwater systems intensely. The first signs of anthropogenic impacts on surface waters in the Berlin-Brandenburg region are approximately 3000 years old. Considering the multiple and intense human uses of surface waters in this region, we analysed when, how and to which extent regional rivers and streams became impacted by dams, water mills and fish weirs resulting in changes in morphology, hydrology and ecological functioning. We hypothesise that the development and growth of cities in this region necessitated (1) efficient navigability of rivers linking them, (2) efficient use of hydropower resources for mills, and (3) significant pollution of surface waters especially with the beginning of industrial development. We analyse these hypotheses by means of three regional examples and delineate the effects of human uses on selected surface water bodies. Understanding the effects of these historic modifications of surface water supports the identification of options for a sustainable use of surface waters that are currently still subjected to multiple uses but face a significant decrease in discharge due to climate change.

TI Neonicotinoid insecticides in global agricultural surface
   waters-Exposure, risks and regulatory challenges
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Neonicotinoids are the most widely used insecticides worldwide. However, the widespread usage of neonicotinoids has sparked concerns over their effects on non-target ecosystems including surface waters. We present here a compre-hensive meta-analysis of 173 peer-reviewed studies (1998-2022) reporting measured insecticide concentrations (MICs; n = 3983) for neonicotinoids in global surface waters resulting from agricultural nonpoint source pollution. We used compound-specific regulatory threshold levels for water (RTLSW) and sediment (RTLSED) defined for pesticide authorization in Canada, the EU and the US, and multispecies endpoints (MSESW) to assess acute and chronic risks of global neonicotinoid water-phase (MICSW; n = 3790) and sediment (MICSED; n = 193) concentrations. Results show a complete lack of exposure information for surface waters in >90 % of agricultural areas globally. However, available data indicates for MICSW overall acute risks to be low (6.7 % RTLSW_acute exceedances), but chronic risks to be of con-cern (20.7 % RTLSW_chronic exceedances); exceedance frequencies were particularly high for chronic MSESW (63.3 %). We found RTLSW exceedances to be highest for imidacloprid and in less regulated countries. Linear model analysis re-vealed risks for global agricultural surface waters to decrease significantly over time, potentially biased by the lack of sensitive analytical methods in early years of neonicotinoid monitoring. The Canadian, EU and US RTLSW differ con-siderably (up to factors of 223 for RTLSW_acute and 13,889 for RTLSW_chronic) for individual neonicotinoids, indicating large uncertainties and regulatory challenges in defining robust and protective RTLs. We conclude that protective threshold levels, in concert with increasing monitoring efforts targeting agricultural surface waters worldwide, are es-sential to further assess the ecological consequences from anticipated increases of agricultural neonicotinoid uses.

TI Groundwater recharge in the oasis-desert areas of northern Tarim Basin,
   Northwest China
SO HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
AB Groundwater is an important source for maintaining desert ecological processes in arid areas. With the increasing intensity of climate change and human activities, the rivers in Tarim Basin are severely dried-up. Aiming at the dried-up river, vegetation degradation and oasis maintenance in the middle and lower reaches of dried-up river basin, groundwater recharge and groundwater-surface water interaction have become hotspots, but are not well known. We examined spatial distributions and controlling factors of groundwater stable isotopes and recharge at oasis scale using data from 247 samples surveyed in the four headwaters in the northern Tarim Basin. Stable isotopes of surface water and groundwater were different from each other, and varied among sampling sites. Surface water and groundwater isotopes generally became enriched towards the east throughout the study area, while surface water isotopes showed enrichment towards the upstream direction within each catchment, mainly due to cultivated area expansion. Surface water mainly originated from precipitation, groundwater, and meltwater, while shallow groundwater derived from lateral groundwater flow, river and irrigated water infiltration, and little precipitation. The mainstream water was directly recharged by the headwaters. The results could provide a new insight into groundwater cycling in oases of dried-up river basins, which is helpful for regional groundwater management.

TI Hydrological connectivity dynamics and conservation priorities for
   surface-water patches in the Yellow River Delta National Nature Reserve,
   China
SO ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY
AB Hydrological connectivity is important for the long-term persistence of water-dependent organism inhabiting floodplain and coastal wetlands, as surface-water patches not only create temporary habitats for them, but also provide dispersal opportunities. Improving understanding of how hydrological connectivity varies with respect to surface-water dynamics is an important step to maintain biodiversity in dynamic coastal environments. Using a series of available remote sensing images, we extracted surface-water patches across a 12-year (2006-2017) and assessed the corresponding hydrological connectivity using the landscape connectivity metrics. Furthermore, we identified important surface-water patches serve as connectivity providers in surface-water networks. Particularly, the threshold distance, needed for analysis of hydrological connectivity, was determined by "Distance- Landscape Connectivity Metrics" curves. We focused on China's Yellow River Delta (YRD), a globally significant floodplain and coastal wetland. Results showed that hydrological connectivity, fluctuating in a range of 0.0726 to 0.0908 during 2006-2017, varied with the number and spatial distribution of water patches. Our study highlight that water patches in Dawenliu Restoration (DR) could serve as ideal high-priority targets for specific management aimed at maintaining or improving hydrological connectivity. We also found that the suitable threshold distance for analyzing hydrological connectivity of the Yellow River Delta National Natural Reserve (YRDNR) is 500 m.

TI Surface Water-Groundwater Interaction in the Guanzhong Section of the
   Weihe River Basin, China
SO GROUNDWATER
AB As a crucial agricultural and economic development zone since the Qin Dynasty (221 to 206 BC), the Guanzhong section of the Weihe River basin is facing serious water resource shortages due to population growth and regional development. Its water resource amount per capita is only 361 m(3), about 1/6 of the average in China and less than 1/20 of the average in the world. Surface water and groundwater (SW-GW) interaction, having a significant influence on the spatiotemporal distribution of water resources, was qualitatively and quantitatively investigated during a wet year based on stable isotopes and hydrochemistry. The results show that the recharge pattern in the north part varies with season, that is, 40% of the surface water recharge comes from groundwater in the dry season, but 93% of the groundwater recharge comes from surface water in the rainy season. In the south part, groundwater is always recharged by surface water, with contributions of 47% and 61% in the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. For the main stream, the recharge pattern is complicated and varies with season and site. This study will provide useful information about SW-GW interaction at basin scale. Integrated management of groundwater and surface water could improve the efficiency of regional water resources utilization and promote accurate and sustainable water management in the semi-arid basin.

TI Active-Passive Surface Water Classification: A New Method for
   high-Resolution monitoring of Surface Water Dynamics
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB This study develops a new, highly efficient method to produce accurate, high-resolution surface water maps. The "active-passive surface water classification" method leverages cloud-based computing resources and machine learning techniques to merge Sentinel 1 synthetic aperture radar and Landsat observations and generate monthly 10-m-resolution water body maps. The skill of the active-passive surface water classification method is demonstrated by mapping surface water change over the Awash River basin in Ethiopia during the 2015 East African regional drought and 2016 localized flood events. Errors of omission (water incorrectly classified as nonwater) and commission (nonwater incorrectly classified as water) in the case study area are 7.16% and 1.91%, respectively. The case study demonstrates the method's ability to generate accurate, high-resolution water body maps depicting surface water dynamics in data-sparse regions. The developed technique will facilitate better monitoring and understanding of the impact of environmental change and climate extremes on global freshwater ecosystems.
   Plain Language Summary Freshwater is one of the world's most important natural resources. However, data scarcity in many parts of the world is a substantial barrier to understanding and predicting the impact of environmental changes on freshwater ecosystems. Satellites provide data on water resources in data-poor regions. The "active-passive surface water classification" method merges observations from two types of sensors, passive sensors from National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Landsat satellites and radar sensors from Sentinel 1 satellites, to generate accurate, high-resolution water body maps. The technique is demonstrated by mapping surface water over the Awash River basin, Ethiopia, during the 2015 East African drought and 2016 flood events. Our results show the severe impact of the drought on basin water bodies, basin recovery to predrought conditions after the 2016 summer rains, and localized flooding from these rains. Our study is one of the first to generate water body maps by merging Landsat and Sentinel 1 data and use them to analyze spatial and temporal water body changes for monthly periods at a 10-m resolution. High-resolution maps of temporal surface water change will help water managers better target humanitarian response efforts, inform water policy decisions, and improve understanding of the impact of environmental change and climate extremes on freshwater ecosystems.

TI Dynamic Analysis in Surface Water Area and Its Driving Factors in
   Northeast China from 1988 to 2020
SO WATER
AB The spatiotemporal changes in surface water area (SWA) in the basins of Northeast China have far-reaching impacts on their economic, agricultural, and social development and ecological sustainability. However, the long-term variation characteristics of water bodies in the Northeast basin and its main driving factors are still unclear. Based on the global surface water dataset, combined with the Meteorological and Vegetation Normalized Index (NDVI) datasets, this study used linear regression and correlation analysis to investigate the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of surface water in Northeast China and its driving factors from 1988 to 2020. The results show that (1) the seasonal surface water area (SSWA) and permanent surface water area (PSWA) in Northeast China increased at the rates of 58.408 km(2)/ year and 169.897 km(2)/ year, respectively, from 1988 to 2020. Taking 2000 as the node, PSWA and SSWA showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing. (2) Changes in surface water types in each basin have significant space-time differences, and the transition between water bodies is dominated by the addition and reduction of seasonal water bodies. PSWA decreased significantly in western basins such as the Ulagai River Basin, the Otindag Desert, and the Liao River Basin, but increased significantly in the Songhua River Basin. (3) The driving forces of surface water change in different basins are different. Temperature and NDVI play a leading role in the change of SWA in the western arid region; permafrost degradation under the condition of air temperature rise is an indispensable factor affecting SWA change in the Argun River Basin; the eastern basin with a larger surface water area responded more strongly to changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration. Land-use conversion and water conservancy project construction were the main reasons for the increase of SWA in the Songhua River Basin under reduced precipitation. This research provides a reference for the in-depth study of the characteristics of surface water resources in Northeast China and has important practical significance for the scientific management of water resources in the basin.

TI GSFLOW-GRASS v1.0.0: GIS-enabled hydrologic modeling of coupled
   groundwater-surface-water systems
SO GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
AB The importance of water moving between the atmosphere and aquifers has led to efforts to develop and maintain coupled models of surface water and groundwater. However, developing inputs to these models is usually timeconsuming and requires extensive knowledge of software engineering, often prohibiting their use by many researchers and water managers, thus reducing these models' potential to promote science-driven decision-making in an era of global change and increasing water resource stress. In response to this need, we have developed GSFLOW-GRASS, a bundled set of open-source tools that develops inputs for, executes, and graphically displays the results of GSFLOW, the U.S. Geological Survey's coupled groundwater and surface-water flow model. In order to create a robust tool that can be widely implemented over diverse hydro(geo) logic settings, we built a series of GRASS GIS extensions that automatically discretizes a topological surface-water flow network that is linked with an underlying gridded groundwater domain. As inputs, GSFLOW-GRASS requires at a minimum a digital elevation model, a precipitation and temperature record, and estimates of channel parameters and hydraulic conductivity. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the toolbox by successfully testing it in environments with varying degrees of drainage integration, landscape relief, and grid resolution, as well as the presence of irregular coastal boundaries. These examples also show how GSFLOW-GRASS can be implemented to examine the role of groundwater-surface-water interactions in a diverse range of water resource and land management applications.

In this paper, the silver diethyldithiocarbamate spectrophotometric method was used to measure arsenic content in surface water. It was concluded that the related coefficient for standard curve was 0.9996, the detection limits was 0.007mg / L, the relative error was below 3.6%, the recovery efficiency of standard adding material was from 90 % to 110 %, which was suitable for measuring arsenic content in large quantities of surface water and wastewater. Through measuring arsenic content in the eight sections of Fen River and in the six drainage of sewage in Taiyuan, the results showed that arsenic content didn ' t exceed emission standards, but which was still higher than that of the environmental water.

TI NCEP-NCAR and ECMWF reanalysis surface water and energy budgets for the
   Mississippi River basin
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
AB Surface water and energy budgets from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalyses are compared here with each other and with available observations over the Mississippi River basin, which is a focus of the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment Continental-Scale International Project. There are a number of noticeable differences and similarities in the large-scale basin averages. The NCEP-NCAR reanalysis seasonal precipitation and runoff are larger than the available observations; presumably, evaporation and surface water variations also are too large. The ECMWF reanalysis precipitation is much closer to the observations, whereas the corresponding surface runoff and seasonal surface water variations are too small. The NCEP-NCAR and ECMWF reanalysis seasonal energy components are more similar to each other. The NCEP-NCAR and ECMWF interannual variations also are comparable, indicating that these reanalyses probably can be used to begin to study interannual variations. Nonetheless, improved land surface parameterizations are needed to depict surface water and energy processes and, in particular, variations in seasonal surface water and runoff better.

TI Review: Groundwater management and groundwater/surface-water interaction
   in the context of South African water policy
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Groundwater/surface-water interaction is receiving increasing focus in Africa due to its importance to ecologic systems and sustainability. In South Africa's 1998 National Water Act (NWA), water-use licenses, including groundwater, are granted only after defining the Reserve, the amount of water needed to supply basic human needs and preserve some ecological integrity. Accurate quantification of groundwater contributions to ecosystems for successful implementation of the NWA proves challenging; many of South Africa's aquifers are in heterogeneous and anisotropic fractured-rock settings. This paper reviews the current conceptualizations and investigative approaches regarding groundwater/surface-water interactions in the context of South African policies. Some selected pitfall experiences are emphasized. The most common approach in South Africa is estimation of average annual fluxes at the scale of fourth-order catchments (similar to 500 km(2)) with baseflow separation techniques and then subtracting the groundwater discharge rate from the recharge rate. This approach might be a good start, but it ignores spatial and temporal variability, potentially missing local impacts associated with production-well placement. As South Africa's NWA has already been emulated in many countries including Zambia, Zimbabwe and Kenya, the successes and failures of the South African experience dealing with the groundwater/surface-water interaction will be analyzed to guide future policy directions.

TI Impact of the COVID-19 lockdown period on surface water quality in the
   Meric-Ergene River Basin, Northwest Turkey
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB The surface water resources in the Meric-Ergene River Basin, especially Ergene River and corlu Stream are among the most polluted rivers in Turkey. Despite the action plans for prevention and control of surface water pollution in the basin, the desired results have not been achieved. However, the implementation of a nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 might probably lead to an improvement in the surface water quality. We evaluated the impact of the lockdown on water quality by measuring the levels of physico-chemical variables and metal(loid)s in water samples taken from 25 sampling stations in the basin. BOD, COD, EC, turbidity, TSS and Mn levels did not show significant differences between the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods due to the ongoing domestic wastewater discharges and agricultural activities in the basin during the lockdown period. However, Cr, Ni, Zn, Cu, As, Pb and Cd concentrations decreased considerably during the lockdown. Similarly, heavy metal pollution index and heavy metal evaluation index values showed a significant improvement in water quality of almost all stations during the lockdown period. Also, total hazard index values for children and adults reduced by 67% and 69%, respectively during the lockdown period, while total carcinogenic risk values for As and Cr reduced by 60% and 94%, respectively. The limited operational status of most industrial facilities in the basin during the lockdown reduced the amount of industrial effluents, leading to significant improvement in surface water quality for metal(loid)s. The lockdown has shown that the solution for preservation and sustainability of natural water resources lies in our hands, and the efficient management of pollution sources can prevent surface water pollution at a very rapid pace. Finally, we suggest that water management policy needs to be improved and implemented.

TI Sustainability of global water use: past reconstruction and future
   projections
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Overuse of surface water and an increasing reliance on nonrenewable groundwater resources have been reported over various regions of the world, casting significant doubt on the sustainable water supply and food production met by irrigation. To assess the limitations of global water resources, numerous indicators have been developed, but they rarely consider nonrenewable water use. In addition, surface water over-abstraction is rarely assessed in the context of human and environmental water needs. Here, we perform a transient assessment of global water use over the historical period 1960-2010 as well as the future projections of 2011-2099, using a newly developed indicator: the blue water sustainability index (BlWSI). The BlWSI incorporates both nonrenewable groundwater use and nonsustainable water use that compromises environmental flow requirements. Our results reveal an increasing trend of water consumed from nonsustainable surface water and groundwater resources over the historical period (similar to 30%), and this increase is projected to continue further towards the end of this century (similar to 40%). The global amount of nonsustainable water consumption has been increasing especially since the late 1990s, despite a wetter climate and increasing water availability during this period. The BlWSI is the first tool suitable for consistently evaluating the renewability and degradation of surface water and groundwater resources as a result of human water over-abstraction.

TI Interaction between surface water and groundwater revealed by
   multi-tracer and statistical approaches in the Baiyangdian Lake
   watershed, North China Plain
SO HYDROLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB The surface water/groundwater-continuum flow system is investigated through an intensive field survey downstream of the Baiyangdian Lake watershed, North China Plain. Oxygen and hydrogen isotope and chemical analyses are conducted on surface water, shallow groundwater, and deep groundwater and the results are processed by applying principal component and cluster analyses. The surface water of the Fu River, Tang Reservoir, and Baiyangdian Lake is strongly affected by anthropogenic influence, resulting in high nitrate-ion concentration, a distinct sodium-sulfate water-type derived from industrial wastewater, and enriched stable isotopic compositions due to accumulated evaporation, respectively. In some areas, shallow groundwater shows close chemical and isotopic affinity to surface water, indicating that surface water recharges to shallow groundwater. Deep groundwater shows lower chemical and isotopic signals than surface water and shallow groundwater. However, a slightly high nitrate-ion concentration is observed in some samples of deep groundwater, suggesting a partial communication between shallow and deep aquifers.

TI Extreme diel dissolved oxygen and carbon cycles in shallow vegetated
   lakes
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB A common perception in limnology is that shallow lakes are homogeneously mixed owing to their small water volume. However, this perception is largely gained by downscaling knowledge from large lakes to their smaller counterparts. Here we show that shallow vegetated lakes (less than 0.6 m), in fact, undergo recurring daytime stratification and nocturnal mixing accompanied by extreme chemical variations during summer. Dense submerged vegetation effectively attenuates light and turbulence generating separation between warm surface waters and much colder bottom waters. Photosynthesis in surface waters produces oxygen accumulation and CO2 depletion, whereas respiration in dark bottom waters causes anoxia and CO2 accumulation. High daytime pH in surface waters promotes precipitation of CaCO3 which is re-dissolved in bottom waters. Nocturnal convective mixing re-introduces oxygen into bottom waters for aerobic respiration and regenerated inorganic carbon into surface waters, which supports intense photosynthesis. Our results reconfigure the basic understanding of local environmental gradients in shallow lakes, one of the most abundant freshwater habitats globally.

AB This paper presents the application of environmental isotopes (O-18/O-16, D/H and Sr-87/Sr-86) to groundwater and surface water studies with emphasis on saline groundwater in aquifers in the Keta Basin. Ghana. The isotopic compositions of oxygen and hydrogen of deep groundwater reveal small variations and plot close to the global meteoric water line. Shallow groundwater and surface water reveal considerably larger variations in the isotopic compositions and show pronounced evaporitic enrichment. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the groundwater and surface water primarily reflect the geology of the formations in the aquifers and the recharge areas. However, groundwater from a number of deep wells and dug wells in near-coastal aquifers is characterized by relatively high Cl contents. A significant marine influence in these aquifers is indicated by well-defined mixing lines for both strontium isotopes, hydrogen and oxygen isotopes with the isotopic composition of modern seawater as one end-member.

TI Aquatic phosphorus behaviour within a UK Ramsar wetland: Impacts of
   seasonality and hydrology on algal growth and implications for
   management
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Fundamental to all life, phosphorus is an essential nutrient and, contrastingly, a significant threat to surface water biodiversity globally as one of the most common causes of eutrophication in surface waters worldwide. Freshwater wetland ditches affected by these conditions undergo a conversion from primarily submerged aquatic vegetation to algae or duckweed dominance, leading to anoxic conditions. However, macrophyte biomass harvesting in eutrophic water systems is a promising means of remediation and nutrient recycling. This study seasonally assesses spatial distribution and chemical fractionation of surface water phosphorus, as well as surface biomass abundance and total phosphorus content in the ditch systems at West Sedgemoor (Somerset, UK), a designated site of special scientific interest. Elevated phosphorus concentrations in the surface water were observed across the site, with all sites exceeding e hi the Common Standards Monitoring environmental quality standard value of 0.1 mg L-1 during summer and autumn Sites lacking hydrological flow connectivity with contaminated freshwater inputs, typically had lower surface water phosphorus concentrations than the rest of the moor, with localised hotspots associated with likely cattle related agricultural activity. Summer and autumn were determined as the dominant duckweed growth seasons, in which an estimated 39 kg of phosphorus could be removed via duckweed biomass harvesting, per harvest period.

TI Local differences in maximum temperature determine water use among
   desert bighorn sheep populations
SO JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT
AB The availability of surface water is assumed by many wildlife managers to be important to desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni). Yet scientific evidence suggests bighorn sheep populations can sometimes fulfill their water requirements from forage alone. To investigate how water use changes with environmental conditions, we analyzed the surface water use and movement patterns of 4 desert bighorn populations across a range of meteorological conditions in the Mojave Desert in California, USA. We compared ground-based weather data to the daily use of surface water sources for 65 known individuals, and examined the movement patterns of 18 of these individuals with global positioning system collars in relation to visitation to surface water sources. Maximum daily temperature most closely predicted the percent of bighorn visiting water daily, with visitation increasing approximately 30% between 30 degrees C and 40 degrees C. Individual animals switched from a tortuous foraging movement to directed movement when accessing surface water. Day length, maximum daily temperature, minimum daily temperature, solar radiation, and the interaction between day length and minimum temperature explained the distance desert bighorn were located from the nearest water source. Our results indicate that local meteorological conditions are important determinants of desert bighorn surface water use, and that managers should monitor water sources when the maximum daily temperature exceeds 35 degrees C. Individual animals meet their water requirements with surface water under hot and dry conditions, likely because it is temporally or energetically efficient given their other resource needs.

TI The profiling of elements and pesticides in surface water in Nanjing,
   China with global comparisons
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The study on high-throughput determination covering various kinds of elements and pesticides in surface water is rarely reported. The surface water samples were collected from the Yangtze River, the Qinhuai River and the Xuanwu Lake in Nanjing which is a large and populous city in eastern China, and elementome (47 elements) and pesticide exposome (60 pesticides) were profiled, which were characterized by univariate and multivariate statistical analysis, literature comparison, and risk assessment. A total of 47 elements and 47 pesticides were detectable. By combining the results of univariate and multivariate statistical analysis, we consistently found that the levels of elements in the Qinhuai River were relatively higher than those in the Yangtze River and the Xuanwu Lake, mainly including rare earth elements and macroelements. The concentrations of isoprocarb, profenofos and simazine in the Yangtze River were relatively higher than those in the Qinhuai River and the Xuanwu Lake. Based on literature search and our data, the results about global element and pesticide concentrations in surface water were summarized. The surface water in Nanjing showed notably higher aluminum level when compared to the level around the world. The risk assessment suggested that arsenic posed a considerable carcinogenic risk. This study provided a large volume of first-hand information about the profiles of elements and pesticides in surface water, which can be used for warning of surface water pollution and preventing potential hazardous effect on public health.

SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB The present study is aimed at investigation of surface water quality of Gulf of Kachchh (GoK), Gujarat. The main objective of this study was to convert complex dataset of water quality parameters from GoK into comprehensive, simple and interpretable observations. Hence, physico-chemical parameters and nutrients of surface water from GoK were analyzed. Chemometric results indicated that oxygen, salinity, dissolved solids, nutrient and natural conditions were the factors that affected surface water quality. The water quality index was calculated to identify water quality classes to evaluate the spatio-seasonal trend in the study area. The results revealed that water quality was moderate in summer, worst in pre-monsoon and best in post-monsoon. The study also highlighted that Marine National Park (Central GoK) was observed to be comparatively in good condition with abundant marine biodiversity. Thus, the results of chemometric study of water quality parameters can be a valuable tool for government authorities for sustainable development of GoK.

TI Probabilistic assessment of groundwater mixing with surface water for
   agricultural utilization
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB Because of limited surface water in reservoirs during a long term drought, this work aimed to locate clean and safe groundwater mixing with surface water for agricultural use in the Chianan plain, southwestern Taiwan subject to its hydrochemical parameters. Based on a standard of water quality for irrigation, multivariate indicator kriging (MVIK) was used to estimate integration of several hydrochemical parameters of groundwater mixing with surface water and to characterize spatial uncertainty. Different utilization ratios (UR) of groundwater regarded as multiple estimated thresholds significantly improved single-threshold drawbacks in previous studies. Recommended regions were determined under various groundwater utilization conditions according to probabilities estimated by MVIK The analyzed results illustrate that groundwater plays a subordinate role in development of agricultural water resources in this plain. After proper dilution with surface water (UR = 0.5 and 0.25), approximately 48.9% of this plain can supply groundwater for irrigation. The northern, northeastern and eastern aquifers are excellent locations to extract groundwater mixing with equal or triple amounts of surface water. The research results provide agricultural administrators and farmers with simple guidelines to obtain sufficient and reliable water for maintaining sustainable production of crops during a long term drought.

SO AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB Good quality surface water and groundwater resources are limited furthermore they are shrinking because of the urbanization, contamination, and climate change impacts. In this backdrop, the proper allocation and management of these resources is a critical challenge for satisfying the rising water demands of agricultural sector. Because irrigated agriculture is the largest user of all the developed water resources and consumes over 70% of the abstracted freshwater globally. The computer-based models are useful tools for achieving the optimal allocation of limited water resources for the conjunctive use planning and management in irrigated agriculture. Various simulation and optimization modeling approaches have been used to solve the water allocation problems. Optimization models have been shown to be of great importance when used with simulation models and the combined use of these two approaches gives the best results. The reviews on the combined applications of simulation and optimization modeling for the conjunctive use planning and management of surface water and groundwater resources for sustainable irrigated agriculture are done and presented in this paper. Conclusions are provided based on this review which could be useful for all the stakeholders. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Per and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) as a contaminant of emerging
   concern in surface water: A transboundary review of their occurrences
   and toxicity effects
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Per and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been recognized as contaminants of emerging concerns by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) due to their environmental impact. Several advisory guidelines were proposed worldwide aimed at limiting their occurrences in the aquatic environments, especially for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). This review paper aims to provide a holistic review in the emerging area of PFAS research by summarizing the spatiotemporal variations in PFAS concentrations in surface water systems globally, highlighting the possible trends of occurrences of PFAS, and presenting potential human health impacts as a result of PFAS exposure through surface water matrices. From the data analysis in this study, occurrences of PFOA and PFOS in many surface water matrices were observed to be several folds higher than the US EPA health advisory level of 70 ng/L for lifetime exposure from drinking water. Direct discharge and atmospheric deposition were identified as primary sources of PFAS in surface water and cryosphere, respectively. While global efforts focused on limiting usages of long-chain PFAS such as PFOS and PFOA, the practices of using short-chain PFAS such as perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) and PFAS alternatives increased substantially. These compounds are also potentially associated with adverse impacts on human health, animals and biota.

TI Heavy metal contamination trends in surface water and sediments of a
   river in a highly-industrialized region
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
AB Surface water and sediment samples from the most contaminated river in Taiwan, Houjing River, were collected for five years (2015 to 2019) and from five locations to study the contamination trends of eight heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Ni, and Zn). Five locations along the river were picked based on their potential of being contaminated by nearby industrial activities. The monitoring data, geo-accumulation index (I-geo), contamination factor (CF), modified degree of contamination (mCd), pollution load index (PLI), and metal index (MI) were used to provide a detailed assessment of the heavy metal contamination. Demin (L3) and Chuwai (L4), two sampling sites close to the Nanzih Export Processing Zone (NEPZ) discharge points, were the most contaminated. The most contaminated periods were 2015-2016 and 2018-2019 for surface water and sediment samples, respectively. The surface water showed signs of heavy metal contamination in 2016 with mCd > 1.5. For the sediment samples, the heavy metal concentration fingerprints for the five years were similar. This implied that the natural attenuation process was not adequate, and treatment technologies are required to improve sediment quality. This study provides a basis for comprehensive risk assessments and integrated environmental management measures for the river's surface water and sediment quality. Also, it would contribute to a more inclusive evaluation of heavy metal contamination in global rivers. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water is the major limiting factor in agriculture in arid and semi arid regions. Change in the hydrologic balance in irrigation areas has resulted in high water tables and salinization of soil. However, where suitable aquifers exist, groundwater pumping and irrigation application after mixing with fresh surface waters can control the secondary salinization of soil and water table depth and improve productivity of degraded land. In this study, the cause of soil salinization in Eli River Valley was analyzed by developing a simplified model for conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater. The model based on mass conservation of salt and water. It enables an estimate to be made of rootzone salinity for particular salinity level of groundwater being used in mixed with surface water. We found that the depth of groundwater recharge through leaching results in the secondary salinization of soil in irrigated area in arid zone, especially under saline groundwater conditions. The results of this study provide a scientific base for the improvement of water quality, sustainable water use and control of soil salinization in the study area.

AB Climate change and increasing urbanization are projected to result in an increase in surface water flooding and consequential damages in the future. In this paper, we present insights from a novel Agent Based Model (ABM), applied to a London case study of surface water flood risk, designed to assess the interplay between different adaptation options; how risk reduction could be achieved by homeowners and government; and the role of flood insurance and the new flood insurance pool, Flood Re, in the context of climate change. The analysis highlights that while combined investment in property-level flood protection and sustainable urban drainage systems reduce surface water flood risk, the benefits can be outweighed by continued development in high risk areas and the effects of climate change. In our simulations, Flood Re is beneficial in its function to provide affordable insurance, even under climate change. However, the scheme does face increasing financial pressure due to rising surface water flood damages. If the intended transition to risk-based pricing is to take place then a determined and coordinated strategy will be needed to manage flood risk, which utilises insurance incentives, limits new development, and supports resilience measures. Our modelling approach and findings are highly relevant for the ongoing regulatory and political approval process for Flood Re as well as for wider discussions on the potential of insurance schemes to incentivise flood risk management and climate adaptation in the UK and internationally.

TI Controllability of Surface Water Networks
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB To sustainably manage water resources, we must understand how to control complex networked systems. In this paper, we study surface water networks from the perspective of structural controllability, a concept that integrates classical control theory with graph-theoretic formalism. We present structural controllability theory and compute four metrics: full and target controllability, control centrality and control profile (FTCP) that collectively determine the structural boundaries of the system's control space. We use these metrics to answer the following questions: How does the structure of a surface water network affect its controllability? How to efficiently control a preselected subset of the network? Which nodes have the highest control power? What types of topological structures dominate controllability? Finally, we demonstrate the structural controllability theory in the analysis of a wide range of surface water networks, such as tributary, deltaic, and braided river systems.

TI Assessing contamination of microplastics in the Ghanaian coastal sea
   using a self-constructed LADI trawl
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB Almost everywhere in the marine ecosystem contains microplastics. Although their environmental contamination is a global problem, relatively little is known about their distribution and abundance in the Gulf of Guinea. This study looked at the spatial dynamics of microplastics in the sea surface water off the coast of Ghana. Four chosen areas were found to have non-variable concentrations ranging from 1.14 to 2.79 particles m-3 using a self -constructed Low-Tech Aquatic Debris Instrument (LADI) trawl (333 mu m mesh). The most abundant shapes were fragments and pellets, while the most common colors were colored and transparent particles. The polymer types found in the microplastics selected for investigation using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy in Attenuated Total Reflectance mode (ATR-FT-IR) were Polypropylene, Polyethylene, and Polystyrene. These re-sults provide an important baseline on microplastic pollution along the Ghanaian coast suggesting the LADI trawl as an accurate quantitative sampling tool for microplastics from sea surface water.

TI Monitoring the dynamics of surface water fraction from MODIS time series
   in a Mediterranean environment
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB Detailed spatial information of changes in surface water extent is needed for water management and biodiversity conservation, particularly in drier parts of the globe where small, temporally-variant wetlands prevail. Although global surface water histories are now generated from 30 m Landsat data, for many locations they contain large temporal gaps particularly for longer periods ( > 10 years) due to revisit intervals and cloud cover. Daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) imagery has potential to fill such gaps, but its relatively coarse spatial resolution may not detect small water bodies, which can be of great ecological importance. To address this problem, this study proposes and tests options for estimating the surface water fraction from MODIS 16-day 500 m Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) corrected surface reflectance image composites. The spatial extent of two Landsat tiles over Spain were selected as test areas. We obtained a 500 m reference dataset on surface water fraction by spatially aggregating 30 m binary water masks obtained from the Landsat-derived C-version of Function of Mask (CFmask), which themselves were evaluated against high-resolution Goggle Earth imagery. Twelve regression tree models were developed with two approaches, Random Forest and Cubist, using spectral metrics derived from MODIS data and topographic parameters generated from a 30 m spatial resolution digital elevation model. Results showed that accuracies were higher when we included annual summary statistics of the spectral metrics as predictor variables. Models trained on a single Landsat tile were ineffective in mapping surface water in the other tile, but global models trained with environmental conditions from both tiles can provide accurate results for both study areas. We achieved the highest accuracy with Cubist global model (R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 11.05%, MAE = 7.67%). Our method was not only effective for mapping permanent water fraction, but also in accurately capturing temporal fluctuations of surface water. Based on this good performance, we produced surface water fraction maps at 16-day interval for the 2000-2015 MODIS archive. Our approach is promising for monitoring surface water fraction at high frequency time intervals over much larger regions provided that training data are collected across the spatial domain for which the model will be applied.

TI Monitoring Surface Water Area Changes in the Aral Sea Basin Using the
   Google Earth Engine Cloud Platform
SO WATER
AB The surface water area and types in the Aral Sea Basin (ASB) have undergone extensive changes due to the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities. This study explores the changes in the surface water area in the ASB based on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform. Then, we integrate multi-source data to identify 1559 lakes and 196 reservoirs from the Joint Research Centre Global Surface Water (JRC GSW) dataset. Our results indicate that the lake area (34,999.61 km(2)) is about 10 times that of the reservoir area (3879.08 km(2)) in the ASB. The total area of surface water in the ASB decreased by 23,194.35 km(2) or 34.58% from 1992 to 2020. Specifically, the areas of permanent water shrunk at a rate of 1278.6 km(2)/year, while the areas of seasonal water increased at a rate of 522.5 km(2)/year. The proportion of lakes and reservoirs in the total surface water has decreased from 79.33% (during 1992-2000) to 75.21% (during 2000-2010) to 63.94% (during 2010-2020). The water that should have flowed into the Aral Sea to maintain its permanent water may have been converted into two parts. Part of it might continue to be permanent water but show up in other regions, while part of it might convert to seasonal water (especially in the Aral Sea itself and the ASB plain area). Our study bridges the limitations of previous studies that have ignored seasonal water change and builds a water area list for 1755 lakes/reservoirs (=0.1 km(2)) for the first time. The results can serve as important knowledge for water resource management and sustainable river basin development in ASB.

TI Spatio-Temporal Analyses of Pesticide Use on Walnuts and Potential Risks
   to Surface Water in California
SO MANAGING AND ANALYZING PESTICIDE USE DATA FOR PEST MANAGEMENT,
   ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, PUBLIC HEALTH, AND PUBLIC POLICY
SE ACS Symposium Series
AB Large-scale analyses of pesticide use and risk patterns are essential for the development of sustainable pest management strategies and regional ecosystem conservation plans. This study investigated the spatio-temporal patterns of pesticide use on walnuts and associated risks to surface water in California. Pesticide use data from 1996 to 2015 were obtained from the Pesticide Use Report (PUR) database, and pesticide risks to surface water were evaluated using the Pesticide Use Risk Evaluation (PURE) indicator. Results show that insecticides posed the highest risks to surface water. The spatial distributions of temperature and humidity partially contributed to the spatial patterns of insecticide and fungicide use. Spatial differences in drainage density, precipitation, and soil permeability determined the spatial patterns of pesticide risk. The significant decreases (p < 0.01) in risks associated with toxic chemicals over time suggested the effectiveness of regulations and awareness of farmers on limiting the use of high-risk pesticides such as chlorpyrifos and maneb. Increasing herbicide use could be attributed to a combination of herbicide resistance, the surge in walnut prices, and the increase in walnut acreage. Increasing use was observed in pyrethroids including bifenthrin as well as herbicide paraquat dichloride, possibly due to their roles as organophosphate and glyphosate alternatives. The results from this study demonstrate the potential of spatially distributed risk indicators in large-scale risk assessments, and provide valuable information for the development of efficient pest management and surface water protection plans in California.

TI The management of urban surface water flood risks: SUDS performance in
   flood reduction from extreme events
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The need to improve the urban drainage network to meet recent urban growth and the redevelopment of old industrial and commercial areas provides an opportunity for managing urban surface water infrastructure in a more sustainable way. The use of sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) can reduce urban surface water flooding as well as the pollution impact of urban discharges on receiving waters. However, these techniques are not yet well known by many stakeholders involved in the decision-making process, or at least the evidence of their performance effectiveness may be doubted compared with more traditional engineering solutions often promoted by existing 1D/2D drainage models. The use of geographic information systems (GIS) in facilitating the inter-related risk analysis of sewer surface water overflows and urban flooding as well as in better communication with stakeholders is demonstrated in this paper. An innovative coupled 1D/2D urban sewer/overland flow model has been developed and tested in conjunction with a SUDS selection and location tool (SUDSLOC) to enable a robust management approach to surface water flood risks and to improve the resilience of the urban drainage infrastructure. The paper demonstrates the numerical and modelling basis of the integrated 1D/2D and SUDSLOC approach and the working assumptions and flexibility of the application together with some limitations and uncertainties. The role of the SUDSLOC modelling component in quantifying flow, and surcharge reduction benefits arising from the strategic selection and location of differing SUDS controls are also demonstrated for an extreme storm event scenario.

TI Simulated groundwater interaction with rivers and springs in the Heihe
   river basin
SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
AB Surface water and groundwater in the Heihe river basin of China are interconnected and the pattern of water resources exploitation has a direct effect on the interaction of groundwater and surface water, especially on a downstream oasis. A three-dimensional groundwater flow simulation model with eight model layers was established to simulate the regional groundwater flow in the multilayered aquifer system and the interaction among the rivers, springs, and groundwater. The model was calibrated not only with historical water levels but also with the investigated baseflow and spring flux. The simulation results of the numerical model match reasonably well with the observed groundwater levels, baseflow to rivers, and spring flux. The numerical simulation also demonstrates that the hydraulic connection between the river and the aquifers has transferred from the coupling to decoupling at some reaches. It is suggested that there is a vital need to reduce groundwater withdrawal and to rationalize the use of both groundwater and surface water in order to maintain sustainable development in the study area.

AB Located on the southeastern part of the Colorado Plateau, the Zuni Mountains are home to the endangered Zuni Bluehead Sucker (ZBS) (Catostomus discobolus yarrowi). A 4-year study was conducted on a low-flow (<80 cm(3)/s) hillslope spring and intermittent stream, that are home to one of the three remaining ZBS populations. Seasonal measurements of physical and hydrochemical parameters were used to estimate the contribution of groundwater to the stream and to identify geologic and hydrologic controls for the spring discharge. Seasonal concentrations and standard deviations (s) of Mg2+ were used to determine that the spring water (5.6 mg/L; s = 0.4) and surface water up-gradient from the spring input (10.7 mg/L; s = 11.2) is from different sources. Surface water down-gradient from the spring input maintain ZBS populations and is a mixture of spring water and up-gradient surface water. Mass solution mixing was used to determine spring water contributes up to 99 percent of the down-gradient water during drier seasons. Isotopes (delta D, delta O-18, H-3) indicate that the spring water has been recharged primarily from snowmelt within the last 70 years, while up-gradient surface water is seasonal runoff from rain and snowmelt. Continuous monitoring of dissolved oxygen (DO) mean concentrations (up-gradient = 1.6 mg/L and down-gradient = 5.7 mg/L) indicated that surface water up-gradient from the spring input are anoxic and unable to support ZBS. Surface water down-gradient from the spring input maintain appropriate DO concentrations due to perennially discharging spring waters re-aerating downstream habitats.

TI Modelling engineered nanomaterials in wet-weather discharges
SO NANOIMPACT
AB The impacts of the unintended release of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) and the resulting exposure to the ecosystems are still poorly understood and intensively debated. In current mass flow models, a global transfer coefficient is used to account for ENMs discharged from sewer systems to surface waters during rain events.
   However, different types of sewer systems and specific ENM applications likely require a more elaborate approach to quantify ENM loads entering surface waters during rain events. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of distinguishing between different application areas of ENMs (indoor/outdoor) and different types of sewer systems (combined/separate) on the loads of selected ENMs passing through wastewater systems and reaching the surface water. We applied a dynamic mass flow analysis to eight substances (TiO2, ZnO, Ag, SiO2, FeOx, CuO, CeO2 and carbon black) for six different sewer system configurations. To estimate the runoff from streets and facades, we used a hydrological model developed for dissolved substances. For areas with separate sewer systems only and ENMs predominantly used in and released from outdoor applications (e.g. CuO, carbon black), up to similar to 80% of the annual loads entering the sewer systems never reach a sewage treatment plant. Those ENMs are directly discharged to surface waters via stormwater outlets. For combined sewer systems and ENMs mainly applied indoors (e.g. Ag, ZnO), the percentage of ENM bypassing sewage treatment plants remains below 2%. Although the model is setup for Switzerland and other geographical areas will show for example different rain characteristics, the relative importance of the different release pathways will broadly remain the same and the results should, therefore, be transferrable to other countries.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
AB Major-ion and stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions were employed in this study of surface water and groundwater contaminations and their impacts on intrinsic hydrochemical evolution in the Yongxiu area, west of Poyang Lake, South China. A total of 36 samples were collected from surface water and groundwater in the study area where water pollution risk is high due to the fertilizer use for farmland and the waste drainage from a nearby silicon industry site. The results show that the surface water bodies have been badly polluted and are characterized by low pH values (minimum 2.85) and high concentrations of chemical compounds such as Cl-, Na+, NH4-N, NO3-N and TDS. Groundwater has also been polluted with the similar specific contaminates, as both surface water and groundwater may have similar contamination sources, and groundwater is recharged from the precipitation infiltration and surface water leakage as indicated by oxygen-18 and deuterium compositions due to the thin unsaturated zone in the area. The acidification and the intrusion of contamination further lead to hydrogeo-chemical reactions and changed hydrochemical type of groundwater from Ca-Mg-HCO3 to Ca-Mg-Na-Cl. The data evaluation methods and results of this study could be useful to the water sustainable usage management in this area and other environmental-vulnerable areas.

AB Conjunctive use of surface and groundwater has proved to be effective in many and and semi and irrigation areas. In Liuyuankou Irrigation System (LIS), most of surface water diverted from the Yellow River is used for rice irrigation in the upstream area, which causes shallow groundwater tables. Surface water and lateral groundwater flow recharges downstream aquifers, and groundwater is pumped for dry land crops. Soil salinisation resulting from shallow groundwater tables in the upstream and increasing groundwater depth in the downstream area threaten the environmental sustainability and economic feasibility of agricultural production. This paper describes modeling tools to develop and implement water saving and sustainable irrigation options for the LIS. Modeling analysis shows that using pumped groundwater in the upstream area is an effective way to increase groundwater depth and thus reduces phreatic evapotranspiration losses and shifting saved surface water to the downstream area can prevent deep groundwater tables in this area. By the proposed innovate strategies of conjunctive use, real water savings and sustainable development can be achieved.

TI Toward a High-Resolution Monitoring of Continental Surface Water Extent
   and Dynamics, at Global Scale: from GIEMS (Global Inundation Extent from
   Multi-Satellites) to SWOT (Surface Water Ocean Topography)
SO SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
AB Up to now, high-resolution mapping of surface water extent from satellites has only been available for a few regions, over limited time periods. The extension of the temporal and spatial coverage was difficult, due to the limitation of the remote sensing technique [e.g., the interaction of the radiation with vegetation or cloud for visible observations or the temporal sampling with the synthetic aperture radar (SAR)]. The advantages and the limitations of the various satellite techniques are reviewed. The need to have a global and consistent estimate of the water surfaces over long time periods triggered the development of a multi-satellite methodology to obtain consistent surface water all over the globe, regardless of the environments. The Global Inundation Extent from Multi-satellites (GIEMS) combines the complementary strengths of satellite observations from the visible to the microwave, to produce a low-resolution monthly dataset () of surface water extent and dynamics. Downscaling algorithms are now developed and applied to GIEMS, using high-spatial-resolution information from visible, near-infrared, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images, or from digital elevation models. Preliminary products are available down to 500-m spatial resolution. This work bridges the gaps and prepares for the future NASA/CNES Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission to be launched in 2020. SWOT will delineate surface water extent estimates and their water storage with an unprecedented spatial resolution and accuracy, thanks to a SAR in an interferometry mode. When available, the SWOT data will be adopted to downscale GIEMS, to produce a long time series of water surfaces at global scale, consistent with the SWOT observations.

AB Based on the regulating principles, the modes of joint regulation and storage of surface water and groundwater in Rushan River Basin are simulated using multi-objective programming method. The study suggests two modes as "two dry years and one normal year" and "four dry years and one wet year". The results indicate the guarantee rates of water supply are improved, with increasing the exploitation quantity in dry years and the recharge in wet years. The study provides a strong guarantee for water resources regulation and promotes the sustainable development of regional water resources.

TI Nonlinear Optimisation Using Production Functions to Estimate Economic
   Benefit of Conjunctive Water Use for Multicrop Production
SO WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB Uncertainty and shortages of surface water supplies, as a result of global climate change, necessitate development of groundwater in many canal commands. Groundwater can be expensive to pump, but provides a reliable supply if managed sustainably. Groundwater can be used optimally in conjunction with surface water supplies. The use of such conjunctive systems can significantly decrease the risk associated with a stochastic availability of surface water supply. However, increasing pumping cost due to groundwater drawdown and energy prices are key concerns. We propose an innovative nonlinear programing model for the optimisation of profitability and productivity in an irrigation command area, with conjunctive water use options. The model, rather than using exogenous yields and gross margins, uses crop water production and profit functions to endogenously determine yields and water uses, and associated gross margins, respectively, for various conjunctive water use options. The model allows the estimation of the potential economic benefits of conjunctive water use and derives an optimal use of regional level land and water resources by maximising the net benefits and water productivity under various physical and economic constraints, including escalating energy prices. The proposed model is applied to the Coleambally Irrigation Area (CIA) in southeastern Australia to explore potential of conjunctive water use and evaluate economic implication of increasing energy prices. The results show that optimal conjunctive water use can offer significant economic benefit especially at low levels of surface water allocation and pumping cost. The results show that conjunctive water use potentially generates additional AUD 57.3 million if groundwater price is the same as surface water price. The benefit decreases significantly with increasing pumping cost.

TI Modeling Surface Water-Groundwater Interactions: Evidence from Borkena
   Catchment, Awash River Basin, Ethiopia
SO HYDROLOGY
AB The availability of sufficient water resources is critical for sustainable social and economic development globally. However, recurrent drought has been a precursor to inadequate water supply in the case of Borkena Catchment, Awash River Basin, Ethiopia. To support the conjunctive use and management of surface water and groundwater in Borkena Catchment, an integrated model was developed using the SWAT-MODFLOW model. The model was designed to operate on a monthly time scale. The change in the water balance obtained from the SWAT-MODFLOW model provides a quantitative means to assess the effect of the climate variability and changes, as well as the impact of human activities, on water resources. To advance the understanding at the regional and local scales, surface water-groundwater interactions in the Borkena Catchment geochemical information and piezometer maps were integrated. The results show that the groundwater recharge in the study area is approximately 122 mm/a. The surface water-groundwater interaction results show that the areas around Harbu and Dessie are characterized as losing rivers, while the areas around Kemisse-Chefa and the highlands of Kutaber, where the Borkena River originates, are characterized as gaining rivers. A geochemical analysis indicated that there is an inter-basin groundwater transfer from the Abbay to the Awash basin. The integrated model generated key temporal and spatial information that is useful for the sustainable conjunctive management of surface and groundwater in Borkena Catchment for climate resilience in the face of climate variability and increasing demand.

SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF PURE & APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Water is one of the most essential and devastating element in the world. The lack of access to water and its abundance can be a serious threat to human life. These two circumstances may create a difficult situation against the sustainability of human life. Inadequate access to water causes drought, affects agriculture and on other side high level water availability in urban areas affects daily life. Hence, mapping and analysing of the surface water of the earth benefits from such impacts. Therefore, this study analysis evaluates the performance of available Landsat-8 OLI images for mapping water bodies and to obtaining precise Normalized Differential Water Index (NDWI) extraction. Change detection analysis of the obtained data shows that the area of the surface water body keeps on changing every year. The surface area of the lake has undergone a drastic change in the year 2019.

TI Impacts of Anthropogenic Land Use Changes on Nutrient Concentrations in
   Surface Waterbodies: A Review
SO CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER
AB Increased population leads to land use (LU) changes from natural to urban and agricultural LU. These disturbances not only decrease the natural treatment potential but they also worsen surface water quality (SWQ). The aim of this review is to assess studies about impacts of anthropogenic LU changes on levels of nutrient concentrations in surface waterbodies, highlighting the important parameters needed for an integrated simulation. The results reported in the literature are not always fully consistent. These contradictory results can sometimes be explained by field measurements under different climatic conditions, different features of landscapes, air deposition rates on ground surfaces, and groundwater flow interactions with surface water. Integrated modelling has been suggested to overcome these inconsistencies. Physical-based and empirical models are the most popular approaches for LU-SWQ studies. Generally, anthropogenic LU such as agricultural and urban areas usually enhances nutrient concentrations much more than natural lands such as forest and barren. Developing sustainable metropolitan areas instead of rural areas, establishing high-standard waste-water treatment plants, and practicing efficient fertiliser application would ameliorate the poor nutrient conditions in SWQ. Riparian vegetation, grassed swales, and construction of artificial wetlands as buffer zones are the most promising natural water quality control measures.

CL Bergen, NORWAY
SP Norwegian Hydrol Council, Nordic Hydrol Assoc
AB Bergen city centre is prone to both subsidence and flooding. With a predicted increase in precipitation due to climate change, a higher proportion of rainfall becomes surface runoff, which results in increased peak flood discharges. In addition, it has been predicted that sea-level rise and increasing storm surges will result in coastal flooding. In this study, the dual hazards of flooding and subsidence are analysed to exemplify possible risk assessment maps for areas most prone to the combination of both. Risk assessment maps are a support tool to identify areas where mitigation of subsidence and adaptation for surface water management will be most efficient and measures can be implemented. The results show that dual hazard assessment, like that described in this paper, can be a useful tool for decision-makers when prioritizing areas to implement measures such as Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems.

TI Greywater irrigation as a source of organic micro-pollutants to shallow
   groundwater and nearby surface water
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Increased water demands due to population growth and increased urbanisation have driven adoption of various water reuse practices. The irrigation of greywater (water from all household uses, except toilets) has been proposed as one potential sustainable practice. Research has clearly identified environmental harm from the presence of micro-pollutants in soils, groundwater and surface water. Greywater contains a range of micro pollutants yet very little is known about their potential environmental fate when greywater is irrigated to soil. Therefore, this study assessed whether organic micro-pollutants in irrigated greywater were transferred to shallow groundwater and an adjacent surface waterway. A total of 22 organic micro-pollutants were detected in greywater. Six of these (acesulfame, caffeine, DEET, paracetamol, salicylic acid and triclosan) were selected as potential tracers of greywater contamination. Three of these chemicals (acesulfame, caffeine, DEET) were detected in the groundwater, while salicylic acid was also detected in adjacent surface water. Caffeine and DEET in surface water were directly attributable to greywater irrigation. Thus the practice of greywater irrigation can act as a source of organic micro-pollutants to shallow groundwater and nearby surface water. The full list of micro-pollutants that could be introduced via greywater and the risk they pose to aquatic ecosystems is not yet known. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Assessing real options in urban surface water flood risk management
   under climate change
SO NATURAL HAZARDS
AB Developing an adaptation option is challenging for long-term engineering decisions due to uncertain future climatic conditions; this is especially true for urban flood risk management. This study develops a real options approach to assess adaptation options in urban surface water flood risk management under climate change. This approach is demonstrated using a case study of Waterloo in London, UK, in which three Sustainable Drainage System (SuDS) measures for surface water flood management, i.e., green roof, bio-retention and permeable pavement, are assessed. A trinomial tree model is used to represent the change in rainfall intensity over future horizons (2050s and 2080s) with the climate change data from UK Climate Projections 2009. A two-dimensional Cellular Automata-based model CADDIES is used to simulate surface water flooding. The results from the case study indicate that the real options approach is more cost-effective than the fixed adaptation approach. The benefit of real options adaptations is found to be higher with an increasing cost of SuDS measures compared to fixed adaptation. This study provides new evidence on the benefits of real options analysis in urban surface water flood risk management given the uncertainty associated with climate change.

TI Multi-tracer approach to understand nitrate contamination and
   groundwater-surface water interactions in the Mediterranean coastal area
   of Guerbes-Senhadja, Algeria
SO JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY
AB Implementing sustainable groundwater resources management in coastal areas is challenging due to the negative impacts of anthropogenic stressors and various interactions between groundwater and surface water. This study focuses on nitrate contamination and transport via groundwater-surface water exchange in a Mediterranean coastal area (Guerbes-Senhadja region, Algeria) that is heavily affected by anthropogenic activities. A multi -tracer approach, integrating hydrogeochemical and isotopic tracers (delta 2HH2O , delta 18OH2O , 3H, delta 15NNO3 and delta 18ONO3), is combined with a Bayesian isotope mixing model (MixSIAR) to (i) elucidate the nitrate sources and their apportionments in water systems, and (ii) describe potential interactions between groundwater and surface water. Results from nitrate isotopic composition and the MixSIAR model show that nitrate concentrations mainly originate from sewage and manure sources. Nitrate derived from the sewage is attributed to urban and rural wastewater discharge, whereas nitrate derived from the manure is related to animal manure used to fertilise agricultural areas. High apportionments of nitrate-based atmospheric precipitation are identified in groundwater and surface water; a finding that is specific to this study. The multi-origin stresses combined with evidence of interactions between surface water and groundwater contribute to negatively impacting large parts of the study coastal area. The outcomes of this study are expected to contribute to sustainable management of coastal eco-systems by drawing more attention towards groundwater use and protection. Furthermore, this study may improve scientists' ability to predict the behavior of anthropogenically impacted coastal ecosystems and help decision-makers elsewhere to prepare suitable environmental strategies for other coastal ecosystems currently undergoing an early stage of groundwater resources deterioration.

TI Enhancing the Visibility of SuDS in Strategic Planning Using Preliminary
   Regional Opportunity Screening
SO ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB Surface water flooding poses significant threats to communities and environments. This threat has historically been managed through sewers and combined sewer overflows; however, it is now well recognised that, alone, these legacy systems are insufficient to manage the growing pressures from climate change, population growth and urbanisation. This realisation has led to research and practice developing a broad range of new technologies to enhance the coping capacities of existing sewer systems through capturing and attenuating or reusing surface water across catchments using sustainable drainage systems (SuDS). However, despite technical understanding, industry champions and significant best practice, SuDS remain underutilised, particularly at a synergistic catchment scale where they can be most effective. In this paper we respond to this challenge by developing preliminary screening tools to enhance the visibility of SuDS among the multidisciplinary decision-makers responsible for directing strategic surface water management. We achieve this through upscaling a regional decision support model and demonstrating implementation across a case study in South West England. We find that it is possible to use easily accessible and open-source data to provide initial indications of SuDS opportunities and that this early visibility in the decision-making process can be used to support the consideration of novel and effective surface water management strategies.

TI Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Surface Water in China from the 1980s
   to 2015 Based on Remote Sensing Monitoring
SO CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
AB Climate change and human interference play significant roles on dynamic of water body abundance, and drive related hydrological, biochemical and social/economic processes. Documenting and monitoring surface water area with high resolution multi-temporal satellite imagery provide new perspective to evaluate the dynamics of surface water area, especially in continental and global scale. In this study, based on the Landsat images from 1980s to 2015, we surveyed the spatial and temporal variation of surface water area, including rivers, lakes and reservoirs, in 10-yr temporal slice across China. Furthermore, the driving forces of the variation has been identified to reveal the interaction of water bodies and the changing environment. The results show that, the water surface area expanded over all three decades with strong spatial and temporal difference, despite the drier and warmer climate background; although lakes comprise the largest portion of the surface water area, the highest contributor of surface water expansion was new constructed reservoir located in the densely populated region; climatic parameters alteration, like precipitation and temperature, resulted in the water surface expansion in the northwestern basin by growing water input linked with rain and glacier melting; in the rest part of China, rise of water surface area was predominately attributed to human relocation of water resource, which yielded more new water storage area than the disappeared water body caused by less precipitation and stronger evapotranspiration. The conclusions highlight the integrative water resource management, especially in water conservation and restoration.

The first observation is that Pu-239,Pu-240 activity concentrations in surface waters of the SOJ during 1977-2019 were 6.5 +/- 4.7 mBq m(-3) in average, and 5.1 mBq m(-3) as the median, whereas Cs-137 and Sr-90 activity concentrations decreased with time, except of the perturbation due to the 2011 Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident. Another observation is that sporadic high Pu-239,Pu-240 activity concentrations occurred in the east Japan Basin, ranging from 1 to 39 mBq m(-3). The spatial distribution of Pu-239,Pu-240 activity concentrations in surface waters revealed that high Pu-239,Pu-240 levels (> 20 mBq m(-3)) occurred in 1994 in the northern SOJ, which was considered to be due to winter convection. To elucidate factors controlling the temporal variability of surface Pu-239,Pu-240 levels in the SOJ, a relationship between surface Pu-239,Pu-240 activity concentrations and vertical diffusion coefficients was examined. The results revealed that this relationship could be classified into two groups: one group did not show a change with increasing diffusion coefficient, while the other group showed a positive correlation. The vertical Pu-239,Pu-240 distribution in SOJ waters suggests that the high surface Pu-239,Pu-240 levels occurred due to the upwelling of cyclonic eddy. The rapid recycling of deeper plutonium occurred in the SOJ due to deep winter convection and upwelling associated with cyclonic eddy. The plutonium levels in the SOJ have been found to be sensitive to climate changes. Warming of the SOJ may cause a reduction of winter convection and eddy activity as a result of increasing sea surface temperature. This leads to a decline of recirculation of plutonium and other bioavailable elements from Japan Sea Proper Water (JSPW) to surface water layers. Plutonium would be, therefore, an important indicator of biogeochemical processes in the marine environment, helping to assess climate change impacts on marine ecological systems.

AB More than 35% of the world's population live within 100 km of the coast. Groundwater resources in these areas are the main source for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. Worldwide, deltaic areas are under stress due to climate change, sea level increase and decrease in fresh water availability. In addition, in deltaic coastal areas around mean sea level, the saline groundwater will move toward the ground surface and exflitrate to surface water. This saline surface water will not be appropriate for drinking water production, agricultural and industrial use, and therefore, freshwater diverted from rivers is used for flushing the canals and ditches in coastal areas. Due to decreasing fresh water availability and increasing surface water salinization, current saline-fresh water management strategies have to be reviewed, and new sustainable strategies must be developed. Using real time measurements to see the effect of disturbances to the system and updating the control actions in real time will decrease the use of fresh water for flushing operations. Real time control of salinity in polders will result in more effective water management. Control of surface water salinization in a polder is a multi-objective problem such that water quality and quantity have to be considered. Moreover, the constraints of the system and uncertainties must be taken into account. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a state-of-the-art control technique showing the best performance for these kind of problems. In this study, a MPC configuration for combined water quantity and quality control is discussed on a polder flushing case study for a hypothetical test water course/canal. The exfiltration of saline groundwater to the surface water is also considered and the predictions of saline groundwater exfiltration are used to achieve better control of the local water system.

TI Pharmaceuticals in farms and surrounding surface water bodies: Hazard
   and ecotoxicity in a swine production area in Costa Rica
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB The presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment is known to have multiple origins; livestock activities comprise one scarcely studied source, both globally and specially in Latin-America. This work aims to study the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in wastewater from swine farms and their surrounding surface waters, in a highland livestock production area of Costa Rica. The monitoring of 70 pharmaceutical active compounds resulted in the detection of 10 molecules in farm wastewater (influents and effluents of the on-farm treatment system), including compounds of animal and human use. A 57% of effluents showed high hazard (Sigma HQ > 1), mainly due to the compounds risperidone, ketoprofen, ibuprofen and naproxen. Additionally, ecotoxicological tests with Daphnia magna and Microtox classified at least 21% of the effluents as very toxic (10 < TU <= 100); likewise, 86% of effluents exhibited germination index (GI) inhibition values over 90% for Lactuca sativa. Seven molecules were detected in surface water, six of them of human use (1,7-dimethylxanthine, caffeine, cephalexin, carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen) and one (acetaminophen) of dual (human and veterinary) use; nonetheless, most of the detections were found in sampling points closer to human settlements than animal farms. Considering the set of molecules and their distribution, the livestock influence on surface water seems minimal in comparison with the urban influence. Only 16% of surface water samples showed high risk, mainly due to ibuprofen, gemfibrozil and caffeine; similarly, 45% samples presented GI inhibition >20% (no toxicity was determined towards Daphnia magna or Microtox). These findings in surface water suggest an incipient environmental risk in the area. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Critical review of salinity intrusion in rivers and estuaries
SO JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
AB There is scientific evidence of accelerated sea level rise and saline intrusion. Some impacts, such as stratification and estuarine circulation, are subtle; others are dramatic including shifts in salt-sensitive habitats and limited water availability of suitable quality for industrial and municipal uses. These results have become a remarkable reality resulting in a set of integrated surface water organisation issues. Tremendous population increases overwhelming many coastal areas have expanded the problem. These challenges have been studied from many perspectives using various objectives and methodologies, and then arriving at different findings. However, all research assured that significant rises in sea level have influenced estuaries and tidally affected rivers, and these observations are expected to become rapidly worse in the future. This study introduces, categorises, critically investigates, and synthesises the most related studies regarding accelerated sea level rise and challenges of the development associated with the resources of surface water in estuaries and tidally-affected rivers. This critical review reveals that there is a need for research that focuses on the development of sustainable surface water resources.

TI Surface water and aerosol spatiotemporal dynamics and influence
   mechanisms over drylands
SO GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
AB Under the background of global warming and excessive human activities, much surface water in drylands is experiencing rapid degradation or shrinkage in recent years. The shrinkage of surface water, especially the degradation of lakes and their adjacent wetlands in drylands, may lead to the emergence of new salt dust storm hotspots, which causes greater danger. In this paper, based on high spatial resolution global surface water (GSW) and multiangle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) AOD data, we systematically analyze the dynamic characteristics of surface water and aerosols in typical drylands (Central Asia, CA) between 2000 and 2018. Simultaneously, combined with auxiliary environment vari-ables, we explore the driving mechanisms of surface water on the regional salt/sand aerosols on different spatial scales. The results show that the seasonal surface water features an increasing trend, especially a more dramatic increase after 2015, and the permanent surface water indicates an overall decrease, with nearly 54.367 % at risk of receding and drying up. In typical lakes (Aral Sea and Ebinur Lake), the inter-annual change feature of the surface water area (WA) is that a continuous decrease during the study per-iod occurs in Aral Sea area, yet a significant improvement has occurred in Ebinur Lake after 2015, and the degradation of Ebinur Lake takes place later and its recovery earlier than Aral Sea. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) in CA shows obvious seasonal variation, with the largest in spring (0.192 +/- 0173), next in summer (0.169 +/- 0.106), and the smallest in autumn (0.123 +/- 0.065). The interannual variation of AOD exhibits an increase from 2000 to 2018 in CA, with high AOD areas mainly concentrated in the Taklamakan Desert and some lake beds resulting from lake degradation, including Aral Sea and Ebinur Lake. The AOD holds a similar trend between Aral Sea and Ebinur Lake on an interannual scale. And the AOD over Ebinur Lake is lower than that over Aral Sea in magnitude and lags behind in reaching the peak compared with Aral Sea. The WA change can significantly affect aerosol variation directly or indirectly on the aerosol load or mode size, but there are obvious differences in the driving mechanisms, acting paths, and influence magnitude of WA on aerosols on different spatial scales. In addition, the increase of WA can significantly directly suppress the increase of Angstrom exponent (AE), and the effects of WA on AOD are realized majorly by an indirect approach. From the typical lake perspective, the effects of WA on aerosol in Aral Sea are achieved via an indirect path; and the decrease of WA can indirectly pro-mote the AOD rise, and directly stimulate the AE growth in Ebinur Lake.(c) 2022 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

TI Hydrologic Control on Arsenic Cycling at the Groundwater-Surface Water
   Interface of a Tidal Channel
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Historical industrial activities have resulted in soil contamination at sites globally. Many of these sites are located along coastlines, making them vulnerable to hydrologic and biogeochemical alterations due to climate change and sea-level rise. However, the impact of hydrologic dynamics on contaminant mobility in tidal environments has not been well studied. Here, we collected data from pressure transducers in wells, multilevel redox sensors, and porewater samplers at an As-contaminated site adjacent to a freshwater tidal channel. Results indicate that sharp redox gradients exist and that redox conditions vary on tidal to seasonal timescales due to sub-daily water level fluctuations in the channel and seasonal groundwater-surface water interactions. The As and Fe2+ concentrations decreased during seasonal periods of net discharge to the channel. The seasonal changes were greater than tidal variations in both Eh and As concentrations, indicating that impacts of the seasonal mechanism are stronger than those of sub-daily water table fluctuations. A conceptual model describing tidal and seasonal hydro-biogeochemical coupling is presented. These findings have broad implications for understanding the impacts of sea-level rise on the mobility of natural and anthropogenic coastal solutes.

TI Global temperature calibration of the alkenone unsaturation index
   (U-37(K ')) in surface waters and comparison with surface sediments
SO GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
AB [1] In this paper, we compile the current surface seawater C-37 alkenone unsaturation (U-37(K')) measurements ( n = 629, - 1 to 30 degrees C temperature range) to derive a global, field-based calibration of U-37(K') with alkenone production temperature. A single nonlinear "global'' surface water calibration of U-37(K') accurately predicts alkenone production temperatures over the diversity of modern-day oceanic environments and alkenone-synthesizing populations (T = - 0.957 + 54.293(U-37(K')) - 52.894(U-37(K'))(2) + 28.321(U-37(K'))(3), r(2) = 0.97, n = 567). The mean standard error of estimation is 1.2 degrees C with insignificant bias in estimated production temperature among the different ocean regions sampled. An exception to these trends is regions characterized by strong lateral advection and extreme productivity and temperature gradients (e.g., the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence). In contrast to the surface water data, the calibration of U-37(K') in surface sediments with overlying annual mean sea surface temperature (AnnO) is best fit by a linear model ( AnnO = 29.876(U-37(K')) - 1.334, r(2) = 0.97, n = 592). The standard error of estimation (1.1 degrees C) is similar to that of the surface water production calibration, but a higher degree of bias is observed among the regional data sets. The sediment calibration differs significantly from the surface water calibration. U-37(K') in surface sediments is consistently higher than that predicted from AnnO and the surface water production temperature calibration, and the magnitude of the offset increases as the surface water AnnO decreases. We apply the global production temperature calibration to the coretop U-37(K') data to estimate the coretop alkenone integrated production temperature ( coretop IPT) and compare this with the overlying annual mean sea surface temperature ( AnnO). We use simple models to explore the possible causes of the deviation observed between the coretop temperature signal, as estimated by U-37(K'), and AnnO. Our results indicate that the deviation can best be explained if seasonality in production and/or thermocline production as well as differential degradation of 37: 3 and 37: 2 alkenones both affect the sedimentary alkenone signal.

TI Small-scale catchment analysis of water stress in wet regions of the US:
   an example from Louisiana
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Groundwater is increasingly being overdrafted in the Southeastern U.S., despite abundant rainfall and the apparent availability of surface water. Using the state of Louisiana as an example, the current study quantifies the stresses on water resources and investigates the potential for opportunities to use surface water in lieu of groundwater pumping. The assessment is based on a fine watershed scale (12-digit Hydrological Unit Code [HUC] boundaries) water balance between the availability of surface and groundwater and surface water and groundwater demand. Water demand includes environmental flows, as well as public supply, rural domestic, industrial, power generation, agricultural, and aquaculture sectors. The seasonality of water stress is also addressed by incorporating monthly variations in surface water supply and irrigation demands. We develop several new weighting schemes to disaggregate the water withdrawals, provided by the U.S. Geological Survey on a county scale, to the HUC12 scale. The analysis on the smaller HUC12 scale is important for identifying areas with high water stress that would otherwise be masked at a larger scale (e.g. the county or HUC8 watershed scales). The results indicate that the annual water stress in Louisiana is below one (i.e. there is more water available than is used) for most watersheds; however, some watersheds (15 of the HUC12 units) show stresses greater than one, indicating an insufficient water supply to meet existing demands. The areas of the highest water stress are largely attributable to water consumption for power generating plants or irrigation. Moreover, estimating the stresses on surface water and groundwater sources separately confirms our speculation of abundant surface water and demonstrates a significant over-drafting/ deficit of groundwater in many of the states aquifer systems. These results have implications for identifying new opportunities for reallocation of surface water use to reduce groundwater pumping and improve water sustainability in the region. Seasonal fluctuations in surface water supply and water withdrawals for irrigation highlight the fact that the water system is under more stress during the summer season. This observation underscores the need for infrastructure for short-term surface water storage in agricultural regions. The water budget analysis presented here can be useful for stakeholders in developing water management plans and can also help to inform the development of a water code that will enable Louisiana to successfully manage and conserve its water resources for the future.

TI Evaluating landscape influences on hydrologic behavior with a
   fully-integrated groundwater - surface water model
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB Optimizing hydrologic resiliency in agricultural landscapes is critical for the sustainability of food production and ecosystem services, and optimization strategies must include a holistic understanding of the hydrologic cycle, including groundwater-surface water interactions. Here, a large-scale (2056 km(2)), high resolution (50-150 m), structurally complex, fully-integrated groundwater-surface water model was constructed for an agriculturally-dominated watershed in the Northern Great Plains. The sensitivity of surface water flow and groundwater conditions were examined in the context of wetland/depression water storage capacity, soil hydraulic conductivity (K-s), field surface roughness (Manning's n), as well as variability in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET). The model evaluation interval extended from 2010 to 2015, which included both flood and drought conditions. Results showed that stream flow rates in the watershed exhibit a larger response to 10 % changes in either precipitation or PET relative to the response associated with a 50 % change in depression storage, a 4x change in K-s, or a 50 % change in n, thus highlighting the region's susceptibility to weather variability. Of the landscape parameters examined, increasing depression storage provided a greater reduction in peak flood flows than an increase in K-s or n; however, increases in all three landscape parameters contributed to flood peak mitigation as well as groundwater recharge. When model configuration approximated predevelopment (primarily native prairie) landscape conditions, simulated flood peaks were reduced by 22 to 25 %. This study presents a fully-integrated groundwater-surface water modeling framework to determine the hydrologic influences and risk mitigation value of landscape management practices.

TI Hydrological and hydrogeological characterization of groundwater and
   river water in the North Hanoi industrial area, Vietnam
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
AB Degradation of groundwater quality by human activities is a widespread environmental problem in Vietnam. Groundwater there is a major source of water for domestic and industrial purposes. This paper reviews, compiles, and comprehensively analyzes spatiotemporal variations of hydrological and hydrogeological characteristics of shallow and deep groundwater aquifers in northern Hanoi industrial zones and in nearby Red River water. Groundwater level, electrical conductivity, and water temperature were measured in six monitoring wells, complemented by anion, cation, and stable isotope analyses of ground and surface water. The results show that the groundwater in both shallow and deep aquifers was fresh, but mainly calcium-bicarbonate type contaminants and human activities affect groundwater and surface water composition. With the goal of devising sustainable water use regulations, more research must be directed toward long-term monitoring of groundwater and surface water quality, as well as toward detailed investigation of the hydraulic characteristics of local aquifers in the study area.

TI In situ bioremediation of surface waters by periphytons
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB Environmentally benign and sustainable biomeasures have become attractive options for the in situ remediation of polluted surface waters. In this paper, we review the current state of reported experiments utilizing naturally occurring periphyton. These are microbial communities consisting of heterotrophic and photoautotrophic microorganisms that are reportedly capable of remediating surface waters which suffer from pollution due to a variety of contaminants. In our review, we focus on four aspects of bioremediation: multiple contaminant removal, the processes involved in contaminant removal, successful cell immobilization technologies and finally, the consideration of safety in aquaculture. It has been noted that recent developments in immobilization technologies offer a fresh approach facilitating the application of periphyton. The use of periphyton biofilm overcomes several disadvantages of single species microbial aggregates. The inclusion of periphyton, as a stable micro-ecosystem, is a promising in situ strategy to restore decimated surface water ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The embodied energy associated with water provision comprises an important part of water management, and is important when considering sustainability. In this study, an input-output based hybrid analysis integrated with structural path analysis was used to develop an embodied energy model. The model was applied to a groundwater supply system (Kalamazoo, Michigan) and a surface water supply system (Tampa, Florida). The two systems evaluated have comparable total energy embodiments based on unit water production. However, the onsite energy use of the groundwater supply system is approximately 27% greater than the surface water supply system. This was primarily due to more extensive pumping requirements. On the other hand, the groundwater system uses approximately 31% less indirect energy than the surface water system, mainly because of fewer chemicals used for treatment. The results from this and other studies were also compiled to provide a relative comparison of embodied energy for major water supply options. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Water is a key variable for the sustainability of the world. Surface water resources are of prime importance for all living creatures. Thus these resources should be monitored for proper water planning. In this study, we aimed to identify which spectral water index will represent water body better when the data of new imaging satellite, namely Sentinel-2, are used. Since these indices were originated from old Landsat missions, it is important to investigate the performances of these indices with other data resources. Catalan and Yedigoze dam reservoirs were considered as the study area. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) were utilized as spectral indices. The obtained results showed that NDWI presented water body better than MNDWI when using Sentinel-2 data. As a statistical metric, the kappa values of NDWI and MNDW were obtained as 0.88 and 0.83 respectively. The results have revealed that remote sensing technology and remotely sensed images are important resources for surface water monitoring and management.

TI Review: Safe and sustainable groundwater supply in China
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Exploitation of groundwater has greatly increased since the 1970s to meet the increased water demand due to fast economic development in China. Correspondingly, the regional groundwater level has declined substantially in many areas of China. Water sources are scarce in northern and northwestern China, and the anthropogenic pollution of groundwater has worsened the situation. Groundwater containing high concentrations of geogenic arsenic, fluoride, iodine, and salinity is widely distributed across China, which has negatively affected safe supply of water for drinking and other purposes. In addition to anthropogenic contamination, the interactions between surface water and groundwater, including seawater intrusion, have caused deterioration of groundwater quality. The ecosystem and geo-environment have been severely affected by the depletion of groundwater resources. Land subsidence due to excessive groundwater withdrawal has been observed in more than 50 cities in China, with a maximum accumulated subsidence of 2-3 m. Groundwater-dependent ecosystems are being degraded due to changes in the water table or poor groundwater quality. This paper reviews these changes in China, which have occurred under the impact of rapid economic development. The effects of economic growth on groundwater systems should be monitored, understood and predicted to better protect and manage groundwater resources for the future.

TI Compilation and analysis of global surface water concentrations for
   individual insecticide compounds
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The decades-long agricultural use of insecticides resulted in frequent contamination of surface waters globally regularly posing high risks for the aquatic biodiversity. However, the concentration levels of individual insecticide compounds have by now not been compiled and reported using global scale data, hampering our knowledge on the insecticide exposure of aquatic ecosystems. Here, we specify measured insecticide concentrations (MICs, comprising in total 11,300 water and sediment concentrations taken from a previous publication) for 28 important insecticide compounds covering four major insecticide classes. Results show that organochlorine and organophosphate insecticides, which dominated the global insecticide market for decades, have been detected most often and at highest concentration levels in surface waters globally. In comparison, MICs of the more recent py-rethroids and neonicotinoids were less often reported and generally at lower concentrations as a result of their later market introduction and lower application rates. An online insecticide classification calculator (ICC; available at: https://static.magic.eco/icc/v1) is provided in order to enable the comparison and classification of prospective MICs with available global insecticide concentrations. Spatial analyses of existing data show that most MICs were reported for surface waters in North America, Asia and Europe, whereas highest concentration levels were detected in Africa, Asia and South America. An evaluation of water and sediment MICs showed that theoretical organic carbon-water partition coefficients (K-OC) determined in the laboratory overestimated KOC values based on actual field concentrations by up to a factor of more than 20, with highest deviations found for highly sorptive pyrethroids. Overall, the comprehensive compilation of insecticide field concentrations presented here is a valuable tool for the classification of future surface water monitoring results and serves as important input data for more field relevant toxicity testing approaches and pesticide exposure and risk assessment schemes.

TI Joint Operation of Surface Water and Groundwater Reservoirs to Address
   Water Conflicts in Arid Regions: An Integrated Modeling Study
SO WATER
AB At the basin scale, the operation of surface water reservoirs rarely takes groundwater aquifers into consideration, which can also be regarded as reservoirs underground. This study investigates the impact of reservoir operation on the water cycle and evaluates the effect of the joint operation of surface water and groundwater reservoirs on the water conflict in arid regions through an integrated modeling approach. The Heihe River Basin (HRB) in northwestern China is selected as the study area. Our results show that the ecological operational strategies of a reservoir under construction in the upper HRB have a direct impact on the agricultural water uses and consequently affect other hydrological processes. The ecological operation strategy with a smaller water release and a longer duration is beneficial to securing the environmental flow towards the downstream area and to replenishing aquifers. With the joint operation of surface water and groundwater reservoirs, a balance among the agriculture water need, the groundwater sustainability in the Middle HRB and the ecological water need in the Lower HRB can be flexibly achieved. However, the joint operation can hardly improve the three aspects simultaneously. To resolve the water conflict in HRB, additional engineering and/or policy measures are desired.

TI A national pilot scheme for monitoring and assessment of ecological
   integrity of surface waters in China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
AB Monitoring of status and trends of quality of surface waters is important to assure sustainability of desired structures and functions of aquatic environments. Recently, several sets of legislation worldwide (USA, European Commission, Canada, Australia, South Africa, etc.) have been developed, that consider water bodies as ecological systems, in order to address ecological quality or integrity of watersheds. Current monitoring and assessment of water quality in China, which is still based on amounts of chemical pollutants, such as ammonia and BOD, has been deemed to be insufficient to adequately assess the quality of aquatic environments. Responding to this challenge, China has embarked on a pilot national monitoring program to assess ecological integrities of major watersheds beginning in 2010. The components used in this monitoring and assessment system include hydrology, river morphology, physico-chemical parameters, ecotoxicological aspects, types and numbers of biota and age and growth of fishes. Based on the results of the pilot scheme an ecological integrity index for surface waters will be established; a national coordination and management system, including methods for comprehensive monitoring of ecological integrity of surface waters in China will be initiated.

TI Assessment of the effect of the climate variations of coastal surface
   water and study of Sepia officinalis spawing
SO VETERINARIA ITALIANA
AB The aim of this study was to establish whether climate change affected migratory behaviour of Sepia officinalis (Linnaeus, 1758), which is an important resource for small-scale fishermen of Abruzzo region (Italy). Starting at the beginning of March until the end of April, the cuttlefish in this area migrates from deep cold water towards warmer coastal waters, where they spawn. Small-scale fishing of cuttlefish is permitted in costal waters from March to September. During the study period, between March and September 2008, both cuttlefish traps and trammel nets were used in 5 sampling areas along the Abruzzo coast to test their relative efficiency in catching cuttlefish. Trapped specimens were counted, weighed and measured, their gender and sexual maturity were also determined. The data obtained from the sampling were correlated to surface water temperature to assess possible changes in migration behaviours. The obtained data show that during the first months of migration (March and April), a greater percentage of large males was caught, while females and smaller males predominated later in the year. The study also showed that surface water temperature did not reveal any significant shifts from the trend over the last 10 years. As for the efficiency of the fishing methods, traps were found to be more effective than trammel nets.

TI Reliable conjunctive use rules for sustainable irrigated agriculture and
   reservoir spill control
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB We develop optimal conjunctive use water management strategies that balance two potentially conflicting objectives: sustaining irrigated agriculture during droughts and minimizing unnecessary spills and resulting water losses from the reservoir during wet periods. Conjunctive use is specified by a linear operating rule, which determines the maximum surface water release as a function of initial reservoir storage. Optimal strategies are identified using multiobjective interannual optimization for sustainability and spill control, combined with gradient-based annual profit maximization. Application to historical conditions in the irrigated system of the Yaqui Valley, Mexico, yields a Pareto curve of solutions illustrating the trade-off between sustaining agriculture and minimizing spills and water losses. Minimal water losses are obtained by maximizing surface water use and limiting groundwater pumping, such that reservoir levels are kept sufficiently low. Maximum agricultural sustainability, on the other hand, results from increased groundwater use and keeping surface water reservoir levels high during wet periods. Selected optimal operating rules from the multiobjective optimization are tested over a large number of equally probable streamflow time series, generated with a stochastic time series model. In this manner, statistical properties, such as the mean sustainability and sustainability percentiles, are determined for each optimal rule. These statistical properties can be used to select rules for water management that are reliable over a wide range of streamflow conditions.

TI AirSWOT InSAR Mapping of Surface Water Elevations and Hydraulic
   Gradients Across the Yukon Flats Basin, Alaska
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB AirSWOT, an experimental airborne Ka-band interferometric synthetic aperture radar, was developed for hydrologic research and validation of the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission (to be launched in 2021). AirSWOT and SWOT aim to improve understanding of surface water processes by mapping water surface elevation (WSE) and water surface slope (WSS) in rivers, lakes, and wetlands. However, the utility of AirSWOT for these purposes remains largely unexamined. We present the first investigation of AirSWOT WSE and WSS surveys over complex, low-relief, wetland-river hydrologic environments, including (1) a field-validated assessment of AirSWOT WSE and WSS precisions for lakes and rivers in the Yukon Flats Basin, an Arctic-Boreal wetland complex in eastern interior Alaska; (2) improved scientific understanding of surface water flow gradients and the influence of subsurface permafrost; and (3) recommendations for improving AirSWOT precisions in future scientific and SWOT validation campaigns. AirSWOT quantifies WSE with an RMSE of 8 and 15cm in 1 and 0.0625km(2) river reaches, respectively, and 21cm in lakes. This indicates good utility for studying hydrologic flux, WSS, geomorphic processes, and coupled surface/subsurface hydrology in permafrost environments. This also suggests that AirSWOT supplies sufficient precision for validating SWOT WSE and WSS over rivers, but not lakes. However, improvements in sensor calibration and flight experiment design may improve precisions in future deployments as may modifications to data processing. We conclude that AirSWOT is a useful tool for bridging the gap between field observations and forthcoming global SWOT satellite products.

TI Antibiotic microbial resistance (AMR) removal efficiencies by
   conventional and advanced wastewater treatment processes: A review
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified the spread of antibiotic resistance as one of the major risks to global public health. An important transfer route into the aquatic environment is the urban water cycle. In this paper the occurrence and transport of antibiotic microbial resistance in the urban water cycle are critically reviewed. The presence of antibiotic resistance in low impacted surface water is being discussed to determine background antibiotic resistance levels, which might serve as a reference for treatment targets in the absence of health-based threshold levels. Different biological, physical and disinfection/oxidation processes employed in wastewater treatment and their efficacy regarding their removal of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance geness (ARGs) were evaluated. A more efficient removal of antibiotic microbial resistance abundances from wastewater effluents can be achieved by advanced treatment processes, including membrane filtration, ozonation, UV-irradiation or chlorination, to levels typically observed in urban surface water or low impacted surface water.

AB The Naoh River Watershed is one of the intensification of agricultural development on the Sanjiang Plain in the past 50 years. Degradation of soil quality caused by large area reclamation on the Sanjiang Plain has been widely reported in research studies. However, issues of water, especially surface water quality patterns and dynamics have drawn little attention. As water is a critical component of regional sustainable development, monitoring and assessment of surface water quality patterns and dynamics will provide an overall knowledge of water conditions and assist in establishing a scientific basis for environmental planning, decision making and effective management. Based on summarized the procedure of fuzzy synthetic evaluation, the quality, of surface water of the Naoli River was assessed by using a Fuzzy Synthetic Evaluation (FSE) model. The results showed that water quality of the main course and its three tributaries of the Naoh River were generally good during the monitoring period, but significant differences existed between the main stream and the tributaries, the mountain area and the low plain, the forest area and the cultivated land. This study indicated that surface water quality was strongly influenced by Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) adjacent to the river. The study provided some valuable information of surface water quality of the Naoli River watershed on the Sanjiang Plain, a representative region of agricultural development and may have general implications on national or global scale.

TI Groundwaters at Risk: Wetland Loss Changes Sources, Lengthens Pathways,
   and Decelerates Rejuvenation of Groundwater Resources
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
AB Wetland loss alters the hydrology of wetlandscapes in poorly understood ways. To quantify the effects of wetland loss on subsurface hydrology, a physically based hydrologic model that simulates the timing and pathways of subsurface hydrologic connections was coupled with wetland inventories over a 50-year period during which substantial wetland loss occurred. The model revealed, based on vertical variations in saturated hydraulic conductivities, wetland loss of different degrees led to a contraction of catchment contributing areas to local surface waters but an expansion of contributing areas to the regional surface water body. This shift in groundwater contributing areas reflected (1) a decrease in baseflow contribution to the local surface water bodies, and (2) an increase in the transit time and length of subsurface hydrologic connections with an associated increase in the magnitude and age of baseflow discharging to the regional surface water body. The model also showed regions with thick permeable aquifers were particularly sensitive to the loss of wetlands. Our ability to predict these changes in hydrology of the watershed provides important support for designing science-based policies to promote sustainable water resource management.

TI The influence of hyporheic exchange with spur dikes: Laboratory
   experiments
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB It is important to understand heat transfer changes in the hyporheic zone of spur dikes when assessing ecological restoration and sustainability in rivers. To reveal the rule of hyporheic exchange under the action of a spur dike, the sinusoidal temperature change of surface water was set with a period of 24 h. The porous subsurface flow paths under different riverbed forms were plotted through dye tracing. In addition, the influences of surface water velocity (U), river width narrowing ratio (L/B), the number of spur dikes and riverbed shape on hyporheic exchange were also studied using the temperature tracing method. The results show that the hyporheic exchange path presents a trend of diagonal flow downstream, first conducting turbulent diffusion upstream and then sinking, with different riverbed morphologies having different path lengths. The temperature of surface water has a significant controlling effect on the temperature field of the riverbed. The sediment temperature change from the water-sediment interface to 0.3 m depth is closer to the sinusoidal trend. The change in surface water velocity (U) has the most significant effect on the temperature amplitude ratio. The temperature field below spur dikes is more susceptible to the impact of spur dikes and usually presents a "semielliptical" high-temperature area. With the increase in surface water velocity (U), river width narrowing ratio (L/B), and the number of spur dikes, the range of hyporheic exchange under the dam head also increases, which is positively related to the vertical section hyporheic exchange flux at the dam head. The local backwater area generated by spur dikes also affects pressure field distribution near spur dikes, but the changes caused by the fluctuation of the riverbed itself are greater than the impact of spur dikes on the riverbed. The water-sediment interface velocity at the spur dike increases sharply, and the upstream 1 m of the dam head gradually experiences upflow, drops sharply after reaching the maximum at the dam head, and then approaches zero after 1 m. There is no obvious upwelling and downwelling at the whole interface.

TI Projection of surface water resources in the context of climate change
   in typical regions of China
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL
AB Climate change and its impact on hydrological processes are overarching issues that have brought challenges for sustainable water resources management. In this study, surface water resources in typical regions of China are projected in the context of climate change. A water balance model based on the Fu rational function equation is established to quantify future natural runoff. The model is calibrated using data from 13 hydrological stations in 10 first-class water resources zones of China. The future precipitation and temperature series come from the ISI-MIP (Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project) climate dataset. Taking natural runoff for 1961-1990 as a baseline, the impacts of climate change on natural runoff are studied under three emissions scenarios: RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Simulated results indicate that the arid and semi-arid region in the northern part of China is more sensitive to climate change compared to the humid and semi-humid region in the south. In the near future (2011-2050), surface water resources will decrease in most parts of China (except for the Liaozhong and Daojieba catchments), especially in the Haihe River Basin and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River Basin. The decrement of surface water resources in the northern part of China is more than that in the southern part. For the periods 2011-2030 and 2031-2050, surface water resources are expected to decrease by 12-13% in the northern part of China, while those in the southern part will decrease by 7-10%.

TI Impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on the aquatic environment associated with
   disinfection byproducts and pharmaceuticals
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB In this study, concentrations of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) and COVID-19 related pharmaceuticals in waste-water effluents and surface water were measured two weeks, three months and eight months after the lockdown in Wuhan. Little temporal variation in DBP concentrations suggested intensified disinfection during the COVID-19 pandemic had limited impacts on the occurrence of DBPs in the aquatic environment. In contrast, the pan-demic led to a significant increase in concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir in wastewater effluents and surface water. The high detection frequency of these pharmaceuticals in surface water after the lockdown highlighted their mobility and persistence in the aquatic environment. The initial ecological risk assessment indicated mod-erate risks associated with these pharmaceuticals in surface water. As the global situation is still rapidly evolving with a continuous surge in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, our results suggest a pressing need for monitoring COVID-19 related pharmaceuticals as well as a systematic evaluation of their ecotoxicities in the aquatic environment.

TI Hydrogeochemical Process and Quality Assessment of Surface Water Around
   Fuli Abandoned Quarries Area, Northern Anhui Province, China
SO POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
AB Surface water is an indispensable water resource of drinking and irrigation, which plays important role on human health and quantity of grain production. Hydrogeochemical process as well as quality assessment of 31 representative surface water samples from 3 typical lakes around Fuli abandoned quarries area were carried out. The cation is dominated by Ca(2+ )and Mg2+, while the anion is dominated by HCO3- and SO42-. The two leading hydrochemical type are SO4 center dot HCO3-Ca center dot Mg (100%) in No. 1 lake, wheres HCO3 center dot SO4-Ca center dot Mg (88.24%) and SO4 center dot HCO3-Ca center dot Mg (11.76%) of No.2 and No.3 lake. The chemical composition of No.1 lake are mainly controlled by carbonate dissolution and ion-exchange, the chemical composition of No.2 and No.3 lake is mainly influenced by both ion-exchange and dissolution of carbonate and silicate minerals, among which rock weathering is the most important factor. The recharging of the lakes is mainly derived from atmospheric precipitation with the existence of evaporation. The surface water in the study area, in general, is suitable for drinking and irrigation. The outcomes of this research provide a better understanding of hydrochemical mechanism of surface water around quarries, and it will help to improve management and sustainable utilization of water resources for local government.

SO SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB Water is a most important natural resource and it occupies a very important role for the overall development of an area. The surface water bodies of the study area (i.e., Raniganj colliery area, West Bengal, India) are extracted from the satellite imagery. The drainage pattern of the study area also conforms to the dendritic pattern. The surface water body of the study area has been generated using the normalized difference water index (NDWI). The distribution of NDWI values is computed from the satellite imagery over the whole study area. Field water samples were collected from Damalia and Baktarnagar high school of Raniganj in Barddhaman district. Water has been collected as a field sample from mining area (abundant), and the samples are tested for the different parameters of the water. This cadastral-level sample data is very much useful for the proper planning and monitoring of the changes in the different environmental parameters at cadastral level that will include the mining/industrial zones within the study area and at the same time these digital databases would be used for sustainable environmental planning. Finally, the surface water map could be used for various purposes like location of well/tube well and irrigation by pump/deep tube well for sustainable agricultural purpose in cadastral/village label and management of subsurface water in this area for future prospect.

TI Microplastics in Surface Waters and Sediments from Guangdong Coastal
   Areas, South China
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Microplastic is an emerging global pollutant that have attracted a great deal of attention from researchers and the public. Guangdong Province has a large population and a relatively well-developed economy, but lacks a modern pollution control system. Guangdong has a long coastline with varying levels of pollution, and little research has been conducted on microplastics. Therefore, we investigated the level of microplastic pollution in coastal areas of Guangdong Province, and the abundance of microplastics in surface waters and sediments at 13 sampling sites. The abundance of microplastics in surface water and sediment samples ranged from 850 to 3500 items/L and 433.3 to 4166.3 items/kg, respectively. Fiber is the main type of microplastics in both surface water and sediment. The sampled microplastics were typically transparent. Raman results show that the surface water sample mainly includes rayon (38.2%), polyethylene terephthalate (16.4%), and ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer (12.7%). This study used the pollution load index method to evaluate the pollution risk of microplastics along the coast of Guangdong, and provided the basis for the formulation of environmental policy.

TI Energy prices, biofuels, and irrigated agriculture
SO INCENTIVES AND INSTRUMENTS FOR SUSTAINABLE IRRIGATION
AB Changing energy prices will alter water allocation and distribution. Water extraction and conveyance may become more costly and demand for hydroelectric power will grow. Increasing demand for hydroelectric power may reduce the price and increase supply of surface water. High energy prices may also lead to an expansion of water-intensive biofuel technology, resulting in a possible increase in the output price of food production. High energy prices may therefore have obvious implications for sustainable irrigation as well as food security. With a focus on surface water systems, the models considered in this chapter can be used to determine the effects of higher energy prices on water use, total agricultural production, and optimal water rates.

TI Quantifying Area Changes of Internationally Important Wetlands Due to
   Water Consumption in LCA
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Wetlands harbor diverse species assemblages but are among the world's most threatened ecosystems. Half of their global area was lost during the last century. No approach currently exists in life cycle impact assessment that acknowledges the vulnerability and importance of wetlands globally and provides fate factors for water consumption. We use data from 1184 inland wetlands, all designated as sites of international importance under the Ramsar Convention, to develop regionalized fate factors (FF) for consumptive water use. FFs quantify the change of wetland area caused per m(3)/yr water consumed. We distinguish between surface water-fed and groundwater-fed wetlands and develop FFs for surface water and groundwater consumption. FFs vary over 8 (surface water-fed) and 6 (groundwater-fed) orders of magnitude as a function of the site characteristics, showing the importance of local conditions. Largest FFs for surface water-fed wetlands generally occur in hyper-arid zones and smallest in humid zones, highlighting the dependency on available surface water flows. FFs for groundwater-fed wetlands depend on hydrogeological conditions and vary largely with the total amount of water consumed from the aquifer. Our FFs translate water consumption into wetland area loss and thus become compatible with life cycle assessment methodologies of land use.

TI Dynamic surface water maps of Canada from 1984 to 2019 Landsat satellite
   imagery
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB Knowledge of the location of surface water in time and space is critical to inform policy on the environment, wildlife, and human welfare. Dynamic surface water maps have been created at continental to global scales from medium and coarse resolution satellite image archives, most notably by Pekel et al. (2016), who mapped global water dynamics from 1984 to 2015 Landsat data. Their occurrence layer, depicting the percentage of time that water was observed in each 30 m resolution cell, has been relied upon heavily by Natural Resources Canada's (NRCan) Emergency Geomatics Service (EGS) to map surface water during flood events. To generate dynamic surface water maps that are optimized for Canada's unique geography, the fully automated EGS surface water mapping methodology was applied in a cloud environment to the 1984-2019 Landsat archive over Canada. National-scale surface water maps and derived inundation frequency akin to Pekel's occurrence, as well as inter -annual wetting and drying trends calculated using per-pixel logistic regression, were produced to form the complete dataset. Separate comparisons of our frequency layer with Pekel's occurrence layer and Canada's water base layer from the National Hydrographic Network (NHN) were conducted. The comparison with Pekel's occurrence showed that our product contains a large number of unique water objects, the majority of which are correct when assessed against Google Earth (GE) imagery. Comparison with the NHN indicated that the NHN contained a large number of permanent water objects that were mapped as ephemeral water objects in our product, with the majority of these being verified in GE as true ephemeral water objects such as floodplains and wetlands. Wetting trends were found to be more than five times greater than drying trends across Canada, with notable wetting in the Prairie Pothole region and Low Arctic verified with examples of statistically significant wetting and drying features. The dataset will enhance EGS flood and river ice mapping operations, provide information on floodplain location and extent, and give insight into the effects of climate change on surface water availability.

TI Application of Irrigation Water Quality Indices and Multivariate
   Statistical Techniques for Surface Water Quality Assessments in the
   Northern Nile Delta, Egypt
SO WATER
AB Under sustainable development conditions, the water quality of irrigation systems is a complex issue which involves the combined effects of several surface water management parameters. Therefore, this work aims to enhance the surface water quality assessment and geochemical controlling mechanisms and to assess the validation of surface water networks for irrigation using six Water Quality Indices (WQIs) supported by multivariate modelling techniques, such as Principal Component Regression (PCR), Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR) and Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression (SMLR). A total of 110 surface water samples from a network of surface water cannels during the summers of 2018 and 2019 were collected for this research and standard analytical techniques were used to measure 21 physical and chemical parameters. The physicochemical properties revealed that the major ions concentrations were reported in the following order: Ca2+ > Na+ > Mg2+ > K+ and alkalinity > SO42- > Cl- > NO3- > F-. The trace elements concentrations were reported in the following order: Fe > Mn > B > Cr > Pb > Ni > Cu > Zn > Cd. The surface water belongs to the Ca2+-Mg2+-HCO3- and Ca2+-Mg2+-Cl--SO42- water types, under a stress of silicate weathering and reverse ion exchange process. The computation of WQI values across two years revealed that 82% of samples represent a high class and the remaining 18% constitute a medium class of water quality for irrigation use with respect to the Irrigation Water Quality (IWQ) value, while the Sodium Percentage (Na%) values across two years indicated that 96% of samples fell into in a healthy class and 4% fell into in a permissible class for irrigation. In addition, the Sodium Absorption Ratio (SAR), Permeability Index (PI), Kelley Index (KI) and Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC) values revealed that all surface water samples were appropriate for irrigation use. The PCR and SVMR indicated accurate and robust models that predict the six WQIs in both datasets of the calibration (Cal.) and validation (Val.), with R-2 values varying from 0.48 to 0.99. The SMLR presented estimated the six WQIs well, with an R-2 value that ranged from 0.66 to 0.99. In conclusion, WQIs and multivariate statistical analyses are effective and applicable for assessing the surface water quality. The PCR, SVMR and SMLR models provided robust and reliable estimates of the different indices and showed the highest R-2 and the highest slopes values close to 1.00, as well as minimum values of RMSE in all models.

TI Quantifying nitrate pollution sources of the drinking water source area
   using a Bayesian isotope mixing model in the northeastern suburbs of
   Beijing, China
SO ISOTOPES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH STUDIES
AB Nitrate pollution has become an environmental problem of global concern. One effective way for controlling the nitrate pollution of water is to identify the pollution source and reduce the input of nitrate. This study traces and quantifies the sources of nitrate contamination to groundwater and surface water in the northeastern suburbs of Beijing, where an emergency groundwater source zone is located. Nitrogen and oxygen stable isotope analysis, geospatial analysis techniques, principal component analysis, correlation analysis, and a Bayesian isotope mixing model were used to achieve our goals. The results show that the main sources of nitrate pollution in groundwater were manure and sewage (M&S) (42.6 %) > soil nitrogen (SN) (26.6 %) > NH4+ in fertilizer and rain (NHF&R) (24.5 %)> NO3- fertilizer (NOF) (5.0 %) > NO3- in atmospheric deposition (NAD) (1.3 %), and main sources of nitrate in surface water were M&S (28.8 %) > SN (20.4 %) > NAD (19.8 %) > NOF (16.5 %) > NHF&R (14.5 %). Due to the high permeability of the aquifer in the study area, there was a strong hydraulic connection between groundwater and surface water. The discharge of treated wastewater (reclaimed water) into the mostly dried river channel in the study area might aggravate nitrate pollution in the groundwater.

TI Two decades of system-based hygienic-microbiological research in Swist
   river catchment (Germany)
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
AB A multidisciplinary research project series has sought to identify and better understand multiple hygienic-microbiological and chemical contaminations from both point sources and diffuse pollution to contribute to the improvement in surface water quality. In the catchment area of the river Swist (Germany), municipal sewage treatment plants were investigated, followed by event-based investigation of combined sewer overflows, rainwater retention basins and diffuse pollution by surface and subsurface run-off as well as drain pipes. Recently, retention soil filters installed between stormwater storage basins and receiving surface waters in order to provide further treatment of combined sewer overflows were investigated. Geographical information system analysis helped to examine the data in their temporal and spatial dimensions. A model for calculating microbial and chemical loads within a catchment area was developed ("Swistbox") which provides an efficient tool for risk assessment. Nearly two decades of investigation has demonstrated that several elements of the landscape's water balance account for surface water pollution from both diffuse and point sources. Depending on land cover characteristics, wastewater technology and the proportion of wastewater as compared to total river water flow, a source can vary in its importance for the catchment area. The findings can be applied for sustainable and health-sensitive catchment management in relation to recreational or agricultural water use as well as ecological aspects.

TI Distribution, Source Identification, and Output flux of Barium in
   Surface Waters in the Sanjiangyuan Region and Qilian Mountain Region of
   Tibetan Plateau
SO BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
AB Water safety concerning Barium (Ba) has become a public issue worldwide. As the "Asian water tower", Tibetan Plateau is the birthplace of many rivers. However, the distribution, source, and output flux of Ba are largely unknown. In this study, surface water samples were collected from different catchments in the Sanjiangyuan Region (SJY) and the Qilian Mountain Region (QLM) in Tibetan Plateau. The concentration of Ba was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, the source of Ba was discussed by a Gibbs diagram, and the output flux of Ba was estimated using the observation data from different hydrological stations. The results showed that the Ba concentrations were less than 160 & mu;g/L, which is much lower than the guideline value of 700 & mu;g/L for surface waters. The main sources of Ba were rock weathering and evaporation concentration. The total Ba output flux from SJY and QLM to downstream waters was 1,240 t/yr, which accounts for about 0.01% of the global freshwater Ba output flux to the ocean. The Ba production rate in Tibetan Plateau was comparable with that in the Arctic rivers. Under the scenario of global warming, water safety issues concerning Ba will be more serious since the output flux of Ba to downstream waters will be increased by intensified rock weathering, evaporation concentration, glacial retreat, and permafrost thawing. This study reveals the Ba flux and production rate in Tibetan Plateau, which will provide important information for evaluating the environmental impact of global warming on public health.

TI Identifying watershed predictors of surface water quality through
   iterative input selection
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A better understanding of diffuse pollution processes distressing surface water bodies is relevant to develop actions focused on the sustainable management of water resources. This research aims to identify relevant watershed variables that explain the spatial variability patterns of surface water quality in lotic mountain water bodies. Twenty-eight candidate variables (10 land cover and land use (LCLU), 6 pedo-topographic (PT), and 12 hydrometeorological (HM)) were defined to explain the concentration of six water quality parameters temperature (T), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), electrical conductivity (EC), and nitrates (NO3-)) in 76 surface water streams of the Andina region, Colombia. The selection of the explanatory variables was carried out by applying an iterative input selection (IIS) algorithm based on highly randomized tree models. The results show that the variability in the concentration of each water quality parameter is explained by a combination of LCLU, HM, and PT variables. LCLU was the most important group of explanatory variables in the selection, followed by HM variables group. This is not the case for DO, where the HM variables show the highest importance. In all the implemented models, the PT variables showed the lowest incidence. This research developed a success approach for identifying basin variables able to contribute to understand non-point sources of pollution, and thus it was not oriented to create a predictive model of water quality, but rather to use machine learning modeling to expose probable relationships between watershed attributes and the quality of surface water. These results can support other water quality studies and territorial planning instruments on the role of watershed-scale variables in diffuse pollution processes in surface water bodies. The implemented algorithm provided modeling flexibility, computational efficiency, and minimum redundancy, allowing a reasonable representation of the observational data set.

TI Evidence of surface water oligotrophy during the Paleocene-Eocene
   thermal maximum: Nannofossil assemblage data from Ocean Drilling Program
   Site 690, Maud Rise, Weddell Sea
SO PALEOCEANOGRAPHY
AB [1] Nannoplankton assemblages at Ocean Drilling Program Site 690 (Maud Rise, Weddell Sea) experienced an abrupt and dramatic transformation at the onset of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) at similar to55 m.y. The major assemblage shift suggests a change from colder, more productive surface waters to warmer, more oligotrophic conditions. Significant restructuring of assemblages during the later part of the PETM indicates that nannoplankton communities were not stable and that surface water conditions changed, although they remained warm and oligotrophic. Combined with benthic foraminiferal assemblage data, nannoplankton assemblage results suggest increased sequestration of nutrients in shelf environments and starvation of the open ocean. Although the PETM was a short-lived event, it appears to have had long-term effects on nannoplankton, leading to the extinction of Fasciculithus, a dominant Paleocene genus.

TI Improving integrated surface water-groundwater modelling with
   groundwater extraction for water management
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
AB The purpose of this study is to improve a simultaneous simulation of surface water and groundwater regimes with groundwater extraction to assess the implications for water management and propose primary solution approaches. The SWAT-MODFLOW model is performed for the Yom and Nan river basins during 2007-2016. The results demonstrate that the model provides an accurate depiction of the streamflow and groundwater heads when groundwater pumping is included. The recharges of surface water and groundwater are 2 times higher than the annual average value in the wet year (2011), whereas they are 3 times below the annual average in the dry year (2015). The downstream of Yom River basin is vulnerable to flooding, while high-terrain areas in Nan River basin are vulnerable to drought events. Capturing surplus water volumes during the wet season by recharging into the aquifer, coupled with improving the river capacity and forest areas, should be a sustainable solution for these issues.

TI Oxygen isotope values of precipitation and surface waters in northern
   Central America (Belize and Guatemala) are dominated by temperature and
   amount effects
SO EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
AB An understanding of the climatic controls on precipitation delta O-18 is required to interpret isotopic records of paleoclimate and paleoaltimetry. However, variations in precipitation delta O-18 in time and space are only poorly known in northern Central America. To test the hypothesis that precipitation and surface water delta O-18 values are dominated by temporal and spatial amount effects, we analyzed delta O-18 in surface waters collected from Guatemala and Belize, and in precipitation from the Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation database for Veracruz, Mexico, and San Salvador, El Salvador. Herein we show that the dominant controls on delta O-18 values of precipitation and surface waters are fairly simple. Temporally, the dominant control on precipitation delta O-18 values is the amount effect, whereby there is an inverse correlation between rainfall amount and delta O-18. Precipitation delta O-18 values decrease by 1.24%omicron per 100 mm increase of monthly rainfall. Spatially. only two variables - distance from the coast and mean catchment altitude - explain 84% of the surface water delta O-18 variability. Surface water delta O-18 values show an altitude effect of -1.9 to -2.4%omicron km(-1) and a continental effect of 0.69%omicron per 100 km once corrected for altitude effects. A decrease in surface water delta O-18 by 3 to 4%omicron from the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean is evident as an isotopic rain shadow on the Pacific slope. Our data also show that river waters in this humid tropical environment are good proxies for delta O-18 values of precipitation in northern Central America. The Guatemala/Belize surface water line is defined as delta D = 8.0 x delta O-18+8.7, which is similar to the meteoric water line at San Salvador of delta D = 8.1 x delta O-18 +10.9. Spatial variability in delta O-18 values is interpreted to reflect 1) progressive rainout of Caribbean-sourced air masses upon traverse of Central America, and 2) the temperature-dependent equilibrium fractionation between vapor and condensate related to the altitude effect. The data show that the northeast trade winds are the dominant moisture source to Central America, mixing with Pacific-derived moisture west of the cordilleran divide. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Global human population growth, advances in the healthcare sectors, investments in research, and aging societies in industrialized countries have led to a substantial increase in the consumption of pharmaceuticals. Simultaneously, advances in analytical methods and technology have allowed the treatment of pharmaceutical substances before release to aquatic environment and detection at low concentration values. Considering the importance of pharmaceuticals as one emerging group of environmental contaminants, this review provides the current state of knowledge on the technology and trends in on-site treatment and detection of common pharmaceuticals in surface waters. We discuss the general aspects and the materials used for constructing technology with selected studies between 2017 and 2021. Additionally, we explore how these materials and technologies help to develop simple but efficient treatment and detection methods for pharmaceuticals in surface waters. Finally, we discuss the future outlooks.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Groundwater-wetlands interaction in coastal lagoon of Almeria (SE Spain)
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
AB Water resources management in coastal wetlands requires the degree of interdependence between groundwater and terrestrial ecosystems to be known. This is especially so in semiarid areas where surface inflows are restricted, marine influence is marked and the evaporation rate is high. Thus, chemistry of surface waters is very variable in the Cerrillos-Punta Entinas wetlands system. Using classical hydrogeochemical tools, the main processes that favor a diversity of water types were described, related to: presence of salt deposits on the lagoon beds, marine origin of the water, and local influence of groundwater. All these factors make it difficult to establish what reference conditions should be used to define "good" water quality of the surface waters-as required by the Water framework directive-and to understand the influence of groundwater on these coastal wetlands. Knowledge about the influence of the different interaction of these factors on the hydrogeochemical dynamics is required for the sustainable management of this protected natural site.

TI Environmental estrogens in surface water and their interaction with
   microalgae: A review
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Environmental estrogens (EEs) have received extensive attention because they interfere with biological endocrine and reproduction systems by mimicking, antagonizing, or otherwise affecting the actions of endogenous hormones. Additionally, harmful algal blooms have become a global problem in surface water. Microalgae, as an essential primary producer, is especially important for aquatic life and the entire ecosystem. The presence of EEs in surface water may be a potential promoting factor for algal blooms, and microalgae may have effects on the degradation of EEs. This review focuses on the distribution and pollution characteristics of EEs in global surface waters, effects of single and mixed EEs on microalgae regarding growth and toxin production, mechanisms of EEs on microalgae at the cellular and molecular level. The impacts of microalgae on EEs were also discussed. This review provides a risk assessment of EEs and identifies essential clues that will aid in formulating and revising the relevant standards of surface water regarding EEs, which is significant for ecosystems and human health.

TI Merging Landsat and airborne LiDAR observations for continuous
   monitoring of floodplain water extent, depth and volume
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB The Darling River system in Australia is under pressure from water extraction and climate change. Management interventions such as environmental flow releases require understanding of water storage dynamics and the connectivity of floodplains and wetlands. Such knowledge can be gleaned from the long observational record of the Landsat series of satellite sensors and high (<5 m) resolution digital elevation models derived from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Here, for the first time, we develop and demonstrate an approach to reconstruct 16-day floodplain water dynamics, including extent, depth, and volume for a long Landsat time series (1987 to present). Time series mapping of surface water extent at 5-m resolution was achieved by topographic downscaling of Landsat-derived surface water data. We propose a simple and effective algorithm to restore missing data in the images caused by, e.g., cloud and shadows, swath edges and the Landsat 7 Scan Line Corrector (SLC) failure, thereby increasing the number of useable images five-fold. The 5-m surface water extent maps clearly delineate the narrow river channel and the boundary of floodplain wetlands. They can capture the development, peak and retreat of flood events. By combining Landsat and airborne LiDAR observations, we produced time series of surface water depth mapping at 5-m resolution, accounting for the degree of hydraulic surface water connectivity. Based on these maps, we derived 16-day floodplain volume dynamics for 1987 to present. The correlation coefficient between upstream river flow records and floodplain volume time series was 0.88, indicating that the estimates were robust. The algorithms developed can be used for ongoing very high-resolution mapping to assist in managing human water use and environmental health in the Murray-Darling Basin.

TI A High-Resolution Airborne Color-Infrared Camera Water Mask for the NASA
   ABoVE Campaign
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB The airborne AirSWOT instrument suite, consisting of an interferometric Ka-band synthetic aperture radar and color-infrared (CIR) camera, was deployed to northern North America in July and August 2017 as part of the NASA Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE). We present validated, open (i.e., vegetation-free) surface water masks produced from high-resolution (1 m), co-registered AirSWOT CIR imagery using a semi-automated, object-based water classification. The imagery and resulting high-resolution water masks are available as open-access datasets and support interpretation of AirSWOT radar and other coincident ABoVE image products, including LVIS, UAVSAR, AIRMOSS, AVIRIS-NG, and CFIS. These synergies offer promising potential for multi-sensor analysis of Arctic-Boreal surface water bodies. In total, 3167 km(2) of open surface water were mapped from 23,380 km(2) of flight lines spanning 23 degrees of latitude and broad environmental gradients. Detected water body sizes range from 0.00004 km(2) (40 m(2)) to 15 km(2). Power-law extrapolations are commonly used to estimate the abundance of small lakes from coarser resolution imagery, and our mapped water bodies followed power-law distributions, but only for water bodies greater than 0.34 (+/- 0.13) km(2) in area. For water bodies exceeding this size threshold, the coefficients of power-law fits vary for different Arctic-Boreal physiographic terrains (wetland, prairie pothole, lowland river valley, thermokarst, and Canadian Shield). Thus, direct mapping using high-resolution imagery remains the most accurate way to estimate the abundance of small surface water bodies. We conclude that empirical scaling relationships, useful for estimating total trace gas exchange and aquatic habitats on Arctic-Boreal landscapes, are uniquely enabled by high-resolution AirSWOT-like mappings and automated detection methods such as those developed here.

TI Sustainable conjunctive water management in irrigated agriculture: Model
   formulation and application to the Yaqui Valley, Mexico
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB [ 1] This paper investigates strategies to alleviate the effects of droughts on the profitability and sustainability of irrigated agriculture. These strategies include conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater resources, and engineered improvements such as lining of irrigation canals and addition of regional pumping well capacity. A spatially distributed simulation-optimization model was developed for an irrigated system consisting of multiple surface water reservoirs and an alluvial aquifer. The simulation model consists of an agronomic component and simulators describing the hydrologic system. The physical models account for storage and flow through the reservoirs, routing through the irrigation canals, and regional groundwater flow. The agronomic model describes crop productivity as a function of irrigation quantity and salinity, and determines agricultural profit. A profit maximization problem was formulated and solved using large-scale constrained gradient-based optimization. The model was applied to a real-world conjunctive surface water/groundwater management problem in the Yaqui Valley, an irrigated agricultural region in Sonora, Mexico. The model reproduces recorded reductions in agricultural production during a historical drought. These reductions were caused by a decline in surface water availability and limited installed pumping capacity. Results indicate that the impact of the historical 8-year drought could have been significantly reduced without affecting profit in wet years by better managing surface water and groundwater resources. Namely, groundwater could have been more heavily relied upon and surface water allocation capped at a sustainable level as an operating rule. Lining the irrigation canals would have resulted in water savings of 30% of historical reservoir releases during wet years, which could have been used in subsequent drier years to increase agricultural production. The benefits of a greater reliance on groundwater pumping by installing additional wells are limited due to pumping restrictions near the coast to avoid seawater intrusion and due to increased pumping costs.

TI Hydrogeochemical signatures for sustainable use of shallow groundwater
   as a thermal resource at groundwater-surface water mixing zone
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
AB From the perspective of carbon neutrality, an environmental management tool for reducing the greenhouse effect, groundwater is a sustainable resource. Geothermal energy systems using a groundwater heat pump (GWHP) utilize groundwater as a thermal resource. In this study, the impacts of the GWHP system on groundwater environment were investigated to suggest an environment management plan for sustainable long-term operation, especially at groundwater-surface water mixing zone. It is important to maintain subsurface environment with a high efficiency of the GWHP system. We monitored groundwater temperature and analyzed hydrogeochemical parameters, including radon isotopes, before, during, and after operation of the system. A self-organizing map (SOM), statistical method, and PHREEQC geochemical modeling were also used. The hydrogeochemical analysis indicated that, after operation, the groundwater wells were affected strongly by the operations. Before operation, the hydrogeochemistry was related to surface water intrusion, as the study site is located in groundwater-surface water mixing zone. The key determinants of the water type were Ca, HCO3, and Cl. The clusters derived through SOM, the Stiff diagram, and radon isotope analysis revealed that groundwater wells located near the injection well have distinct anomalies related to the operations. The PHREEQC results also supported this interpretation, with carbonate scaling being predominant. The findings of this study suggest that groundwater wells located near a GWHP system or surface water should be managed more intensively than the wells further from the system. Totally, our results demonstrate that groundwater chemistry reflects the impact of GWHP systems on shallow groundwater, and could inform efficient strategies for managing mixing zones of two water bodies based on SOM and PHREEQC modeling.

TI Spatial-Temporal Distribution and Ecological Risk Assessment of
   Microplastic Pollution of Inland Fishing Ground in the Ubolratana
   Reservoir, Thailand
SO WATER
AB Microplastic pollution has been identified as a potential threat to the aquatic environment and humans globally, with widespread occurrence in ecosystems, including reservoirs that constitute a key role in ecosystem services for humans. However, the evaluation of microplastic pollution in reservoirs is limited, especially in inland fishing ground reservoirs. The spatial and temporal distributions of microplastics in surface water and sediment at 13 stations of the Ubolratana Reservoir, Thailand, were assessed during the wet and dry seasons. The abundance and morphological characteristics of the microplastics were identified and classified by color, shape, size and polymer type. Microplastic abundance in surface water and sediment ranged between 25 and 3363 particles/m(3) and 6 and 81 particles/kg, respectively. Seasonal variations impacted microplastic abundance in surface water, while tourism activity in the reservoir also influenced the abundance and morphological characteristics of microplastics. A microplastic risk assessment showed that the pollution load index reached extremely high levels in surface water during the dry season in tourist areas. The results provide a database to assess the risk of microplastic contamination and to monitor plastic pollution in lentic ecosystems, including preserving the health of aquatic habitats.

TI Effects of short-term flooding on arsenic transport in groundwater
   system: A case study of the Datong Basin
SO JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION
AB Hydrogeological and geochemical approaches were combined to investigate the impact of a short-term artificial flooding event on arsenic and associated hydrogeochemisty at a field monitoring site of high arsenic aquifers in Datong Basin, northern China. The groundwater levels fluctuated in response to the flooding (the surface water level and groundwater level fluctuated with time in a range of over 80 cm and 30 cm, respectively), indicating groundwater-surface water interaction. Redox indices, major ions, trace element concentrations, O, H and Sr isotope compositions for surface water and groundwater were determined before and after the flooding. delta H-2 and delta O-18 values for all water samples plot close to the global meteoric water line (GMWL); a subset of the samples (shallow wells) averagely increased from -11.78 to -1126 for delta O-18 and from -86.59 to -83.49 for delta H-2, commensurate with mixing with similar to 10% surface water. The relationship between compositions of strontium isotope Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios and Mg concentration also clearly indicates the effect of mixing between groundwater and surface water. Before and after the flooding, there were obvious variations in water chemistry, including arsenic concentrations. Increases and positive correlations between Cl and Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and SO42- following flooding revealed surface water infiltration into groundwater, plus additional input from dissolution of evaporate minerals and/or evaporated pore-water. Organic matter and oxygen are carried into groundwater together with surface water; oxidation of organic matter leads to exhaustion of oxygen and consumption of terminal electron acceptors (e.g. ferric iron, sulfate, nitrate) inducing a more reducing groundwater environment (indicated by decreased ORP values). Consequently, reductive dissolution of iron oxides/hydroxides resulted in an observed elevation of HS, NH4-N, Fe(II), with the concentrations increasing from 5 mu g/L to 10 mu g/L, from 0.19 mg/L to 0.68 mg/L and from 0.06 mg/L to 1.86 mg/L, respectively. This may explain that the As concentrations were enhanced after surface water flooding (from mean value of 22.6 mu g/L to 31 mu g/L). However, a positive correlation was observed between enhance values of As and Cl in the groundwater after flooding is interpreted as reflecting re-dissolution of evaporate crusts and/or saline pore water during infiltration, and this may alone explain the increase in As observed in the groundwater. Surface water As concentration increased to a minor degree following flooding also (from 14 mu g/L to 15.1 mu g/L), possibly reflecting return flow of the high As groundwater during a temporary switch to gaining conditions.

TI Surface water resource assessment of paddy rice production under climate
   change in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta: a system dynamics modeling
   approach
SO JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
AB Water demands and stresses in the Vietnam Mekong Delta (VMD) are of high concern for the coming decade. System dynamics modeling (SDM) can be used to understand the impacts of the changes on water resources at a regional scale. SDM framework was applied to assess the impacts of land use changes and climate on surface water resource in the VMD. The developed model was modified from a global-scale model and added in-situ specific variables to model the conditions of the VMD using historical data during 1986-2005, and future projections to 2050 under two Representative Concentration Pathways scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Projected changes in land use and population were based on the most recent governmental resolution to support adaptation and the national plans. Temperature and rainfall changes cause the increase in water stress; however, it could be mitigated by shifting from three to two crops of rice each year. Water stress differs from place to place, such as in freshwater and brackish coastal zones. Water stress is most strongly affected by changed temperature, rather than rainfall. The developed system dynamics model and framework can be effectively applied in the VMD to support decision-making about sustainable water use for paddy rice.

TI Spatial pattern of surface water quality in China and its driving
   factors-implication for the environment sustainability
SO HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT
AB Previous studies on water quality in China have been limited within a relatively constrained geographical area to interpret the relationships between water quality and its controlling factors. Such limited choice may give unreliable results, and a national study may help fill this gap. We first interpreted the dominant drivers controlling spatial patterns of surface water quality in the whole China at three scales (watershed, 1-km-buffer, and self-defined zone). The higher responsibility coefficients in spatial water quality models of urban and cropland than other lands imply that both urbanization and crop production have shown severe impact on surface water quality, accompanying with a dilution effect from rainfall at all spatial scales. Finally, a first exponential response of water quality measures to the scenarios of land use and land cover change had been originally demonstrated at the national level, suggesting higher sensitivity of clear water in some remote areas to potential pollutants, and a big challenge for improving the degraded water quality in some areas under intensive human activities. Our findings highlighted that it is urgent for decision-makers to make a scientific and reasonable macro-level policy for the sustainable development of water resources in China.

AB Urbanization is regarded as the development of a country, and this process brings modernization of society with a positive impact. Nowadays, housing developments need to include green spaces towards a sustainable lifestyle. Thus, some of the developers choose to build projects near the existing recreational area or surface water environments. Hence, the transformation and expansion of residential and economic activities near waterbodies such as lakes and rivers have lowered the quality of this surface water system. Moreover, severe environmental pollution has been worsened especially in surface water located in urban areas. This study aims to determine the water quality status of Metropolitan Lake, Kuala Lumpur before and after the treatment of activated carbon and sand filtration method. Here, physical and chemical characteristics were conducted for in-situ and laboratory analysis. Temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), total dissolved solids (TDS) and turbidity of water samples were taken in-situ. Meanwhile, parameters of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS), ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N) were determined in the laboratory. Before the treatment process, the classification of water quality index (WQI) for the sample of Metropolitan Lake, Kuala Lumpur was in class IV. However, after the two treatments of activated carbon and sand filtration, the water class of WQI has improved to class II. Thus, it is important to enhance the water quality through pre-treatment on the surface water system as this source of water is vital for water security and ecosystem surroundings.

TI Methods for Estimating Surface Water Storage Changes and Their
   Evaluations
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
AB Developing effective methods for estimating regional-scale surface water storage change (ASW) has be-come increasingly important for water resources studies and environmental impact assessment. Three methods for estimat-ing monthly ASW are proposed in this study, of which one is based on land surface runoff and two that use water body water budgets. Water areas observed by Landsat satellites for Canada's entire landmass are used for evaluation of the re-sults. The surface runoff method achieved the least satisfactory results, with large errors in the cold season or dry regions. The two water-budget methods demonstrated significant improvements, particularly when water area dynamics is consid-ered in the estimation of the water body water budget. The three methods performed consistently across different climate regions in the country and showed better correlations with observations over wet climate regions than over dry regions with poorly connected hydrological system. The results also showed the impact of glacier and permanent snow melts over the Rocky Mountains on basin-scale surface water dynamics. The methods and outputs from this study can be used for cali-brating and validating hydrological and climate models, assessing climate change and human disturbance impacts on regional water resources, and filling the ASW data gaps in GRACE-based total water storage decompositions studies.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate methods for estimating re-gional-scale surface water storage change. This is important because information on surface water dynamics is limited for water resources studies and environmental impact assessment. Our study makes available two new methods which significantly improve on surface water storage estimation from the traditional runoff model. A guide on controls of sur-face water dynamics is provided for regions under various hydroclimate and physiographic-hydraulic conditions and reveals the influence of glacier melt on surface water variations.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB Firstly, a new global floodability index with a resolution of 3 arc-second is built from topography-based information provided by the MERIT database, using a neural network approach. The topography and permanent water were defined in a coherent way, ensuring the coherency between the resulting floodability index and permanent water, which is unprecedented in previous versions. The evaluation of the floodability index is done with independent observation datasets on surface water and land cover, showing good performances in areas where surface water is naturally driven by topography conditions and limitation in human-affected areas and some specific environments like peatland. Secondly, some of the applications that the floodability index can serve are introduced, including downscaling low-resolution data, analyzing and comparing datasets at different resolution, and data fusion.

AB When natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding or even wars occur, victims of these natural catastrophes or man-made events are usually displaced from their homes to temporary environments such as refugee camps (RCs) and internally displaced persons (IDP) camps. For these victims of disasters to be comfortable and live healthy in their temporary homes, necessities such as good water supplies, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) must be accessible within the camps. In addition, shelter and food supply and non-food supplies are required after a disaster occurrence. Following the provision of shelter, food and non-food supplies, water supply and sanitation facilities such as toilets and latrines, it is very important for the camps or temporary settlements to have effective surface water drainage infrastructure to mitigate environmental health risks and flooding. An effective surface water drainage system can help keep these camps free of surface water flooding, contamination of drinking water supplies by cross-mixing with wastewater, mosquito infestations, stagnant water depressions and growth of aquatic weeds. This paper provides a simplified guidance and methodology in designing, constructing and implementing techniques for best management practice addressing surface water drainage for such scenarios. The paper reviews current drainage infrastructure, difficulties and past mistakes from such systems, retrofitting techniques and novel tools in improving the effectiveness of existing drainage infrastructures in refugee camps, IDP camps and other temporary settlements.

TI Groundwater recharge in suburban areas of Hanoi, Vietnam: effect of
   decreasing surface-water bodies and land-use change
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Over-exploited groundwater is expected to remain the predominant source of domestic water in suburban areas of Hanoi, Vietnam. In order to evaluate the effect on groundwater recharge, of decreasing surface-water bodies and land-use change caused by urbanization, the relevant groundwater systems and recharge pathways must be characterized in detail. To this end, water levels and water quality were monitored for 3 years regarding groundwater and adjacent surface-water bodies, at two typical suburban sites in Hanoi. Stable isotope (delta O-18, delta D of water) analysis and hydrochemical analysis showed that the water from both aquifers and aquitards, including the groundwater obtained from both the monitoring wells and the neighboring household tubewells, was largely derived from evaporation-affected surface-water bodies (e.g., ponds, irrigated farmlands) rather than from rivers. The water-level monitoring results suggested distinct local-scale flow systems for both a Holocene unconfined aquifer (HUA) and Pleistocene confined aquifer (PCA). That is, in the case of the HUA, lateral recharge through the aquifer from neighboring ponds and/or irrigated farmlands appeared to be dominant, rather than recharge by vertical rainwater infiltration. In the case of the PCA, recharge by the above-lying HUA, through areas where the aquitard separating the two aquifers was relatively thin or nonexistent, was suggested. As the decrease in the local surface-water bodies will likely reduce the groundwater recharge, maintaining and enhancing this recharge (through preservation of the surface-water bodies) is considered as essential for the sustainable use of groundwater in the area.

TI A review of pharmaceutical occurrence and pathways in the aquatic
   environment in the context of a changing climate and the COVID-19
   pandemic
SO ANALYTICAL METHODS
AB Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are increasingly being identified as contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). They have potentially detrimental ecological and human health impacts but most are not currently subject to environmental regulation. Addressing the life cycle of these pharmaceuticals plays a significant role in identifying the potential sources and understanding the environmental impact that pharmaceuticals may have in surface waters. The stability and biological activity of these "micro-pollutants" can lead to a pseudo persistence, with ensuing unknown chronic behavioural and health-related effects. Research that investigates pharmaceuticals predominantly focuses on their occurrence and effect within surface water environments. However, this review will help to collate this information with factors that affect their environmental concentration. This review focuses on six pharmaceuticals (clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, venlafaxine, gemfibrozil and diclofenac), chosen because they are heavily consumed globally, have poor removal rates in conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants (CAS WWTPs), and are persistent in the aquatic environment. Furthermore, these pharmaceuticals are included in numerous published prioritisation studies and/or are on the Water Framework Directive (WFD) "Watch List" or are candidates for the updated Watch List (WL). This review investigates the concentrations seen in European Union (EU) surface waters and examines factors that influence final concentrations prior to release, thus giving a holistic overview on the source of pharmaceutical surface water pollution. A period of 10 years is covered by this review, which includes research from 2009-2020 examining over 100 published studies, and highlighting that pharmaceuticals can pose a severe risk to surface water environments, with each stage of the lifecycle of the pharmaceutical determining its concentration. This review additionally highlights the necessity to improve education surrounding appropriate use, disposal and waste management of pharmaceuticals, while implementing a source directed and end of pipe approach to reduce pharmaceutical occurrence in surface waters.

TI A data-driven model for real-time water quality prediction and early
   warning by an integration method
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Due to increasingly serious deterioration of surface water quality, effective water quality prediction technique for real-time early warning is essential to guarantee the emergency response ability in advance for sustainable water management. In this study, an effective data-driven model for surface water quality prediction is developed to analyze the inherent water quality variation tendencies and provide real-time early warnings according to the historical observation data. The developed data-driven model is integrated by an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) for selecting optimal initial weight parameters of neural a network and a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) for adjusting appropriate connection architectures of neural network. First, improved genetic algorithm is used to optimize the reasonable initial weight parameters and prevent the developed model from selecting a local optimal result. Second, BPNN is applied to adjust appropriate connection architectures and identify the features of water quality variation. The developed model is then applied to forecast the surface water quality variations for real-time early warning in Ashi River, China, comparing with simple BPNN model. The prediction results demonstrate that the developed data-driven model can significantly improve the prediction performance both in prediction accuracy and reliability, and effectively provide real-time early warning for emergency response.

TI Rural Ghanaian households are more likely to use alternative unimproved
   water sources when water from boreholes has undesirable organoleptic
   characteristics
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
AB Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 aims to achieve universal access to safe drinking water sources. However, the health benefits of meeting this goal will only be fully realized if improved sources are used to the exclusion of unimproved sources. Very little is known about how rural African households balance the use of improved and unimproved water sources when multiple options are present. We assessed parallel use of untreated surface water and unimproved hand-dug wells (HDWs) in the presence of boreholes (BHs) using a semi quantitative water use survey among 750 residents of 15 rural Ghanaian communities, distributed across three BH water quality clusters: control, high salinity, and high iron. Multivariate mixed effects logistic regression models were used to assess the impact of water quality cluster on the use of BHs, HDWs, and surface water, controlling for distance to the nearest source of each type. Reported surface water use was significantly higher in the high salinity and high iron clusters than in the control cluster, especially for water-intensive activities. Respondents in the non-control clusters had approximately eight times higher odds of clothes washing with surface water (p < 0.01) than in the control. Respondents in the high salinity cluster also had 4.3 times higher odds of drinking surface water (p < 0.05). BH use was high in all clusters, but decreased substantially when distance to the nearest BH exceeded 300 m (OR = 0.17-0.25, p < 0.001). Water use from all sources was inversely correlated with distance, with the largest effect observed on HDW use in multivariate models (OR = 0.02, p < 0.001). Surface water and HDW use will likely continue despite the presence of BHs when perceived groundwater quality is poor and other water sources are in close proximity. It is essential to account for naturally-occurring but undesirable groundwater quality parameters in rural water planning to ensure that SDG 6 is met and health benefits are realized.

AB Groundwater is an important water resource in Chuoshui Alluvial Fan. Due to the uneven distribution of precipitation on this 2000 km(2) area, people rely on groundwater to supplement the insufficient surface water supply during dry season. Excessive withdrawal of groundwater leads to serious environmental impacts: besides problems of groundwater contamination, land subsidence and seawater intrusion impose immense losses in land and property. Therefore, appropriate groundwater management strategies are imperative in the region. This paper introduces several major groundwater management strategies being applied in the Chuoshui Alluvial Region which are groundwater and surface water conjunction use plan, groundwater monitoring system, artificial recharge program. The effects, of these groundwater management strategies will be monitored, evaluated, and modified if necessary, in order to achieve the goals of curtailing land subsidence and ensure sustainable use of groundwater resource.

TI Hydrogeochemistry and Isotope Hydrology of Surface Water and Groundwater
   in the Mountain Watersheds of Daqing River, North China
SO WATER
AB Surface water and groundwater interaction variations in time and space are crucial for effective water management, especially in low-precipitation regions. To comprehensively determine the hydrochemical characteristics and interaction processes of surface water and groundwater and to investigate the decreasing causes of water resources in semi-arid mountainous watersheds under changing environments, intensive field surveys were conducted in the Daqing River watershed, a tributary of the Haihe River basin in northern China, during two different times of the year: after the rainy season (September 2018) and before the rainy season (July 2019). Sixty surface water and groundwater samples were collected along the mountainous watershed. Using a combination method of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope tracing and hydrochemical analysis, the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and hydrochemical characteristics of surface water and groundwater in the mountainous watershed of the Daqing River were analyzed. Furthermore, the effect of elevation (altitude) on isotopes was discussed, and the correlation between hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition and hydrochemical characteristics was obtained. The results were processed using endmember mixing analysis to determine the amount of contribution of the surface water and groundwater interaction processes. The results show that the hydrochemical characteristics are relatively stable in the mountainous watersheds of the Daqing River, and the surface water and groundwater are mainly of the HCO3-Ca type. The slope of the local meteoric water line is smaller than the slope of the global meteoric water line, and the delta D and delta O-18 in surface water and groundwater show a good linear relationship both before and after the rainy season. There is a decreasing trend of the value of delta O-18 in surface water samples with decreasing altitude, but a decreasing trend of the value of delta O-18 in groundwater samples is not obvious. The evaporation intensity of surface water is stronger after the rainy season than before the rainy season, and the connection between the surface water and the groundwater is stronger before the rainy season. Influenced by topographic conditions and other factors, the exchange of surface water and groundwater is frequent, and there is a large difference in the exchange ratio before and after the rainy season. The exchange ratio can be more than 50% after the rainy season. Thus, the reasons for decreasing water resources in the mountains can be implied to be due to the increasing hydraulic gradient between the mountains and the piedmont plains, and the water resources are discharged more in the form of groundwater to the downstream. The conclusions help to enhance the understanding of the water cycle in the mountainous watershed and can provide some theoretical basis for the sustainable development and utilization of water resources in the Haihe River basin and the regional water ecology of the Xiong'an New Area.

TI Remote sensing applications for reservoir water level monitoring,
   sustainable water surface management, and environmental risks in Quang
   Nam province, Vietnam
SO JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
AB Monitoring surface water provides vital information in water management; however, limited data is a fundamental challenge for most developing countries, such as Vietnam. Based on advanced remote sensing technologies, the authors proposed a methodology to process satellite images and use their outcomes to extract surface water in water resource management of Quang Nam province. Results of the proposed study show good agreement with in situ measurement data when the obtained Overall Accuracy and Kappa Coefficient were greater than 90% and 0.99, respectively. Three potential applications based on the surface water results are selected to discuss sustainable water management in Quang Nam province. Firstly, reservoir operating processes can be examined, enhanced, and even developed through long-term extracted water levels, which are the interpolation results between the extracted surface water area and the water level-area-volume curve. Secondly, the long-term morphological change for the Truong Giang river case between 1990 and 2019 can also be detected from the Water Frequency Index performance and provided additional information regarding permanent and seasonal water changes. Lastly, the flood inundation extent was extracted and separated from permanent water to assess the damage of the Mirinae typhoon on 2 November 2009 in terms of population and crop aspects.

TI A systematic literature analysis of the nature and regional distribution
   of water pollution sources in Nigeria
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Water quality monitoring and assessment helps to determine the purity of water and how safe it is for use. This also guides environmental engineers in identifying the pollution sources and developing appropriate strategies in mitigating them. The aim of this study was to systematically analyse published literature to identify the interaction of the nature and regional distribution of pollution sources in Nigeria in the domain of surface water, groundwater, and rainwater quality. The scope of the analysis was on published literature on the subject in the last two decades. Regional distribution was observed to affect pollution sources for surface water, groundwater and rainwater in Nigeria as differences were observed in each geopolitical zone. Several research questions were raised which became the focus of the literature analysis. The major sources of surface water, groundwater and rainwater pollution in Nigeria were identified as industrial effluent (18% of research output), hydrogeology (25% of research output), and roof type (31%) respectively. Some 13% of surface water sources, 17% of groundwater sources and 8% of rainwater sources were adjudged to be clean based on World Health Organisation guidelines. The onus still falls on government related stakeholders, policy makers and industry based decision makers to instigate, develop and actualise sustainable waste management and water treatment approaches in the mitigation of water pollution in the country. The current study provides key information that could influence such decisions especially in view of the choice of process type for cleaner production that would cater for the specific needs of the various geopolitical zones.

TI Antimicrobial resistance genes are enriched in aerosols near impacted
   urban surface waters in La Paz, Bolivia
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Antibiotic resistance poses a major global health threat. Understanding emergence and dissemination of antibiotic resistance in environmental media is critical to the design of control strategies. Because antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) may be aerosolized from contaminated point sources and disseminated more widely in localized environments, we assessed ARGs in aerosols in urban La Paz, Bolivia, where wastewater flows in engineered surface water channels through the densely populated urban core. We quantified key ARGs and a mobile integron (MI) via ddPCR and E. coli spp. as a fecal indicator by culture over two years during both the rainy and dry seasons in sites near wastewater flows. ARG targets represented major antibiotic group-s-tetracyclines (tetA), fluoroquinolines (qnrB), and beta-lactams (bla(TEM))-and an MI (intI1) represented the potential for mobility of genetic material. Most air samples (82%) had detectable targets above the experimentally determined LOD: most commonly bla(TEM) and intI1 (68% and 47% respectively) followed by tetA and qnrB (17% and 11% respectively). ARG and MI densities in positive air samples ranged from 1.3 x 10(1) to 6.6 x 10(4) gene copies/m(3) air. Additionally, we detected culturable E. coli in the air (52% of samples <1 km from impacted surface waters) with an average density of 11 CFU/m(3) in positive samples. We observed decreasing density of bla(TEM) with increasing distance up to 150 m from impacted surface waters. To our knowledge this is the first study conducting absolute quantification and a spatial analysis of ARGs and MIs in ambient urban air of a city with contaminated surface waters. Environments in close proximity to urban wastewater flows in this setting may experience locally elevated concentrations of ARGs, a possible concern for the emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in cities with poor sanitation.

TI Potential Impacts of Induced Bank Filtration on Surface Water Quality: A
   Conceptual Framework for Future Research
SO WATER
AB Studies on induced bank filtration (IBF), a cost-effective and reliable drinking water production method, usually focus on processes affecting the target drinking water quality. We aim to expand this view by assessing potential impacts of IBF on surface water quality. We suggest that IBF can directly and indirectly affect several physical, chemical and biological processes in both the sediment and open water column, eventually leading to positive or negative changes in source water quality. Direct effects of IBF comprise water level fluctuations, changes in water level and retention time, and in organic content and redox conditions in littoral sediments. Indirect effects are mainly triggered by interrupting groundwater discharge into the surface water body. The latter may result in increased seasonal temperature variations in sediment and water and reduced discharge of solutes transported by groundwater such as nutrients and carbon dioxide. These changes can have cascading effects on various water quality, e.g., by facilitating toxic phytoplankton blooms. We propose investigating these potential effects of IBF in future field and laboratory studies to allow for more detailed insights into these yet unknown effects and their magnitude in order to assure a sustainable application of this valuable technique in the future.

TI Modified heavy metal Pollution index (m-HPI) for surface water Quality
   in river basins, India
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB India is bestowed with huge amount of surface water resources. However, India lacks the quality monitoring of surface water and comprehensive management for sustainable surface water development. A new approach for indexing has been proposed to represent pollution due to heavy metals in surface water. Heavy metal pollution indices (m-HPI) for 60 surface water samples in the peninsular stretch were evaluated during pre-drought, drought and post-drought condition. The Index will be represented by a Positive Index (PI) and a Negative Index (NI), where PI represents the level pollution exceeding the maximum desirable limit and NI reflects the index within the required limit. The PI is assigned as 0 when indicators are present below the detection limit or equal to the maximum required limit. However, the value calculated for NI could be 0 to -1 when the indicators are equal to or less than the suggested maximum desirable limit, and the value could be -1 when the indicators are present below the suggested detection limit. The spatiotemporal variation of water quality pattern was studied by the interpolation maps extracted from ArcGIS. The results are compared with WHO standard to validate the drinking water quality. The calculated indices indicated the suitability of water for domestic and irrigation purposes. The developed indexing system is user friendly, robust, flexible and may evaluate the index considering any water quality standard.

AB Surface water storage and fluxes in rivers, lakes, reservoirs and wetlands are currently poorly observed at the global scale, even though they represent major components of the water cycle and deeply impact human societies. In situ networks are heterogeneously distributed in space, and many river basins and most lakes-especially in the developing world and in sparsely populated regions-remain unmonitored. Satellite remote sensing has provided useful complementary observations, but no past or current satellite mission has yet been specifically designed to observe, at the global scale, surface water storage change and fluxes. This is the purpose of the planned Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission. SWOT is a collaboration between the (US) National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (the French Spatial Agency), the Canadian Space Agency and the United Kingdom Space Agency, with launch planned in late 2020. SWOT is both a continental hydrology and oceanography mission. However, only the hydrology capabilities of SWOT are discussed here. After a description of the SWOT mission requirements and measurement capabilities, we review the SWOT-related studies concerning land hydrology published to date. Beginning in 2007, studies demonstrated the benefits of SWOT data for river hydrology, both through discharge estimation directly from SWOT measurements and through assimilation of SWOT data into hydrodynamic and hydrology models. A smaller number change or have quantified improvements expected from SWOT compared with current knowledge of lake water storage variability. We also briefly review other land hydrology capabilities of SWOT, including those related to transboundary river basins, human water withdrawals and wetland environments. Finally, we discuss additional studies needed before and after the launch of the mission, along with perspectives on a potential successor to SWOT.

TI Assessing the effects of water withdrawal for hydraulic fracturing on
   surface water and groundwater - a review
SO METEOROLOGY HYDROLOGY AND WATER MANAGEMENT-RESEARCH AND OPERATIONAL
   APPLICATIONS
AB The interaction between groundwater and surface water plays an important role in the function of riparian ecosystems and sustainable water resource management. Hydraulic fracturing, an unconventional oil and gas well stimulation method, has increased dramatically in North America in an effort to exploit previously inaccessible shale oil and gas reserves. Hydraulic fracturing often requires several thousand cubic meters of water to fracture the source formations. Use of such a high volume of water has raised considerable public concern over the sustainability of this activity and the potential impacts on surface water and groundwater. This paper provides a review of the published literature addressing the effects of water withdrawal for hydraulic fracturing on surface water and groundwater. The potential effects of such withdrawal are: decreased volume of water in rivers, streams, lakes and aquifers; alteration of natural flow regimes; regional water shortages during periods of drought; creating conflicts with other water users in water-stressed regions; inadequate downstream water availability; reduced downstream water quality for human uses, due to less water availability for dilution; and degradation of habitat and aquatic ecosystem function, impacting local wildlife. This review demonstrates that relatively little attention has been paid to quantify and understand these interactions, and suggests that there is a significant need for further research in this area to address the currently limited availability of data.

TI The cost of ending groundwater overdraft on the North China Plain
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB Overexploitation of groundwater reserves is a major environmental problem around the world. In many river basins, groundwater and surface water are used conjunctively and joint optimization strategies are required. A hydroeconomic modeling approach is used to find cost-optimal sustainable surface water and groundwater allocation strategies for a river basin, given an arbitrary initial groundwater level in the aquifer. A simplified management problem with conjunctive use of scarce surface water and groundwater under inflow and recharge uncertainty is presented. Because of head-dependent groundwater pumping costs the optimization problem is nonlinear and non-convex, and a genetic algorithm is used to solve the one-step-ahead subproblems with the objective of minimizing the sum of immediate and expected future costs. A real-world application in the water-scarce Ziya River basin in northern China is used to demonstrate the model capabilities. Persistent overdraft from the groundwater aquifers on the North China Plain has caused declining groundwater levels. The model maps the marginal cost of water in different scenarios, and the minimum cost of ending groundwater overdraft in the basin is estimated to be CNY5.58 billion yr(-1). The study shows that it is cost-effective to slowly recover the groundwater aquifer to a level close to the surface, while gradually lowering the groundwater value to the equilibrium at CNY2.15 m(-3). The model can be used to guide decision-makers to economic efficient long-term sustainable management of groundwater and surface water resources.

TI A review of distribution and risk of pharmaceuticals and personal care
   products in the aquatic environment in China
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB Due to the extensive use and pseudo-persistence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), they are frequently detected in the aqueous environment, which has attracted global attention. In this paper, accumulation data of 81 PPCPs in surface water or sediment in China were reported. In addition, 20 kinds of PPCPs with high frequency were selected and their ecological risk assessment was conducted by risk quotient (RQs). The results indicated that the concentration detected in surface water and sediment ranged from ng/L (ng/kg) to ?g/L (?g/kg) in China, which was similar to concentrations reported globally. However, contamination by certain PPCPs, such as caffeine, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin, was relatively high with a maximum concentration of more than 2000 ng/L in surface water. RQs revealed that 14 kinds of PPCPs pose no significant risk or low risk to aquatic organisms, while 6 kinds of PPCPs pose a high risk. Additionally, the pollution characteristics of PPCPs in each watershed are different. The Haihe River watershed and the central and lower Yangtze River were the regions of high concern for erythromycin. Triclosan has potential risks in the Pearl River watershed. This study determined the occurrence and risk of PPCPs in China in the past decade, providing a scientific basis for PPCPs pollution control and risk prevention.

TI Arsenic pollution in Quaternary sediments and water near a former gold
   mine
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Contamination of water and sediments with arsenic and heavy metals is a global issue affecting human health. Regions covered with Quaternary deposits have received little attention from the point of view of the flux of arsenic and heavy metals from sediments to surface water. This study aims to determine the flux of arsenic and other heavy metals from Quaternary sediments to surface waters in an area affected by the former Zoty Stok gold and arsenic mine. Contamination in surface waters and sediments was caused by arsenic, whereas concentrations of metals were usually within water quality standards. Arsenic contamination of surface water increased in the lower part of the basin covered by Quaternary sediments, and exceeded water quality standards by 2 orders of magnitude. Arsenic mass flux exceeded 8 kg/day near the confluence of the Trujca River with the Nysa Kodzka, a main tributary of the Oder River. An increase in arsenic concentration in the lower part of the basin is related to mine tailings and preferential flow of groundwater through Quaternary sediments. In future, water resources scarcity may lead to an increase in arsenic contamination in surface and groundwater.

TI Long-Term Changes in Water Body Area Dynamic and Driving Factors in the
   Middle-Lower Yangtze Plain Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB The accurate monitoring of long-term spatial and temporal changes in open-surface water bodies offers important guidance for water resource security and management. In the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the monitoring of water body changes is especially critical due to the dense population and drastic climate change. Due to the complexity of the physical environment in which the water bodies are located, the advantages and disadvantages of various water body detection rules can vary in large-scale areas. In this paper, we use Landsat 5/7/8 data to extract the area of water bodies in the study area and analyze their spatial and temporal trends from 1984 to 2020 using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We propose an improved water body extraction rule based on an existing multi-indicator water body algorithm that combines impervious surface data and digital elevation model data. In this study, the performance of the improved algorithm was cross-validated using seven other water body indicator algorithms, and the results showed the following: (1) the rule accurately retained information about the water body while minimizing the interference of shadows on the extracted water body. (2) On the annual scale from 1984 to 2020, the open-surface water body dataset extracted using this improved rule showed that the turning point for the area of each water body type was 2011, with an overall decreasing trend in area before 2011 and an increasing trend in area after 2011, with the exception of special years, such as 1998. (3) The driving mechanism analysis showed that, overall, precipitation was positively correlated with the water body area and temperature was negatively correlated with the water body area. Additionally, human activities can have an impact on surface water dynamics. The key influencing factors are diverse for each water body type; it was found that seasonal water bodies were correlated with precipitation and paddy fields and permanent water bodies were correlated with temperature and urban construction. The accurate monitoring of the spatial and temporal dynamics of open-surface water performed in this study can shed light on the sustainable development of water resources and the environment.

TI Changes in Marine Prokaryote Composition with Season and Depth Over an
   Arctic Polar Year
SO FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB As the global climate changes, the higher latitudes are seen to be warming significantly faster. It is likely that the Arctic biome will experience considerable shifts in ice melt season length, leading to changes in photoirradiance and in the freshwater inputs to the marine environment. The exchange of nutrients between Arctic surface and deep waters and their cycling throughout the water column is driven by seasonal change. The impacts, however, of the current global climate transition period on the biodiversity of the Arctic Ocean and its activity are not yet known. To determine seasonal variation in the microbial communities in the deep water column, samples were collected from a profile (1-1000 m depth) in the waters around the Svalbard archipelago throughout an annual cycle encompassing both the polar night and day. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons was used to monitor prokaryote diversity. In epipelagic surface waters (<200 m depth), seasonal diversity varied significantly, with light and the corresponding annual phytoplankton bloom pattern being the primary drivers of change during the late spring and summer months. In the permanently dark mesopelagic ocean depths (>200 m), seasonality subsequently had much less effect on community composition. In summer, phytoplankton-associated Gammaproteobacteria and Flavobacteriia dominated surface waters, whilst in low light conditions (surface waters in winter months and deeper waters all year round), the Thaumarchaeota and Chlorotlexi-type SAR202 predominated. Alpha-diversity generally increased in epipelagic waters as seasonal light availability decreased; OTU richness also consistently increased down through the water column, with the deepest darkest waters containing the greatest diversity. Beta-diversity analyses confirmed that seasonality and depth also primarily drove community composition. The relative abundance of the eleven predominant taxa showed significant changes in surface waters in summer months and varied with season depending on the phytoplankton bloom stage; corresponding populations in deeper waters however, remained relatively unchanged. Given the significance of the annual phytoplankton bloom pattern on prokaryote diversity in Arctic waters, any changes to bloom dynamics resulting from accelerated global warming will likely have major impacts on surface marine microbial communities, those impacts inevitably trickling down into deeper waters.

TI Reassessment of Physico-Chemical Water Quality in Setiu Wetland,
   Malaysia
SO SAINS MALAYSIANA
AB Setiu Wetland is located in the southern part of South China Sea, Malaysia. This wetland has diverse ecosystems that represent a vast array of biological diversity and abundance in utilizable natural resources. However, there are large scales of aquaculture activities within and nearby the wetland which could threaten the ecosystems of this area. Thus, the main goal of the study was to assess the impact of these activities through the measurement of physico-chemical water quality parameters and then compare this to a previous study carried out in the same study area. The parameters (salinity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand and total suspended solids) were monitored monthly at the surface water from July to October 2008. The results showed that the impact of aquaculture activities on the water quality in the area with dissolved oxygen and total suspended solids concentrations were considerably lower than those observed previously. With respect to the Malaysian Marine Water Quality Criteria and Standard, most of the level of parameters measured remained Class 1, suggesting the physico-chemical environment were in line with sustainable conservation of the marine protected areas and marine parks of this wetland area.

TI Scope and Challenges of Sustainable Drinking Water Management in Assam
SO URBAN ECOLOGY, WATER QUALITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE
SE Water Science and Technology Library
AB Results of the Arsenic Screening and Surveillance Program in Assam revealed 29% of a total 56,180 public sources analyzed to be above the WHO safety guideline of 10 mu g/L, exposing an unguarded population of 8,47,064 to the risk of arsenic contamination and resultant health hazard. Water security and water safety have thus emerged as a major concern in Assam. With surface water resource often contaminated with bacteriological, inorganic, and organic contaminants, groundwater continues to be the major source of drinking water especially in rural Assam. Arsenic contamination of groundwater sources and unreliability of surface water sources have led to an increased concern regarding safe drinking water supply in affected areas. Results of the Arsenic Screening and Surveillance Program demonstrated that the Titabor area lying along the southern bank of the Brahmaputra River in Assam is one of the arsenic hot spots in the region. This led to the formulation of the largest piped water supply scheme in the state to provide arsenic-free safe water to a design population of 1,90,000. Surface water from two tributaries of the Brahmaputra River, viz., Dhansiri and Dayong, is used to supply arsenic-free treated safe water. While adequate surface water availability in the vicinity of such high arsenic-contaminated aquifers has provided a viable alternative, this is infeasible in areas with discreet contaminated sources with scarce surface water sources nearby. Thus, an integrated approach based on groundwater and surface water can be a strategy; the choice often depends on surface water availability and sustainability of deeper safe aquifers subject to economic viability. Composite solutions like integration of rainwater harvesting structures, water recharging, delineation and safeguarding safe aquifers, reuse and recycling, water saving technologies, and smart systems are part of a composite option necessitated for addressing the gaps and inadequacies in ensuring safe drinking water in the region.

TI Origin, transport and ecological risk assessment of illicit drugs in the
   environment - A review
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Illicit drugs are a novel group of emerging pollutants. A growing global environmental load and ecological risk is created by the ongoing release of these toxins into the environment. Conventional water processing plants fail to completely remove drugs of abuse from both surface water and wastewater. The origin, environmental fate and ecological repercussions of illicit drugs, despite their detection in surface waterways around the world, are not well understood. In this review, illicit drug detections in potable water, surface water and wastewater globally have been studied during the past 15 years in order to establish a baseline for future years. The most common drugs with abuse potential detected in different sources of potable and surface water were methadone (0.12-22.7 ng/L), cocaine (0.05-506.6 ng/L), benzoylecgonine (0.07-1019 ng/L), amphetamine (1.4-342.6 ng/L), and codeine (0.002-42 ng/L). The bulk of research only looked at a small number of drugs of abuse, indicating that despite widespread use, a large spectrum of these intoxicants has yet to be detected. This review focuses on the origin of illicit drug contaminants in water bodies, air, and soil, their persistence in the environment, and the typical concentrations at which they occur in the environment. The impact of these drugs on aquatic organisms like Elliptio complanata mussels, crayfish and zebrafish has also been reviewed.

TI Construction of High Spatial-Temporal Water Body Dataset in China Based
   on Sentinel-1 Archives and GEE
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Surface water is the most important resource and environmental factor in maintaining human survival and ecosystem stability; therefore, timely accurate information on dynamic surface water is urgently needed. However, the existing water datasets fall short of the current needs of the various organizations and disciplines due to the limitations of optical sensors in dynamic water mapping. The advancement of the cloud-based Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and free-sharing Sentinel-1 imagery makes it possible to map the dynamics of a surface water body with high spatial-temporal resolution on a large scale. This study first establishes a water extraction method oriented towards Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data based on the statistics of a large number of samples of land-cover types. An unprecedented high spatial-temporal water body dataset in China (HSWDC) with monthly temporal and 10-m spatial resolution using the Sentinel-1 data from 2016 to 2018 is developed in this study. The HSWDC is validated by 14,070 random samples across China. A high classification accuracy (overall accuracy = 0.93, kappa coefficient = 0.86) is achieved. The HSWDC is highly consistent with the Global Surface Water Explorer dataset and water levels from satellite altimetry. In addition to the good performance of detecting frozen water and small water bodies, the HSWDC can also classify various water cover/uses, which are obtained from its high spatial-temporal resolution. The HSWDC dataset can provide more detailed information on surface water bodies in China and has good application potential for developing high-resolution wetland maps.

TI Spatio-Temporal Assessment of Changing Land Surface Temperature and
   Depleting Water in the Lake Chad Area
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
AB Lake Chad is located at the south of the Sahara Desert in an arid region. The lake's water resources are under severe pressure due to the basic needs of the growing population around the lake, global warming, and increasing irrigation demands. Numerous land cover change studies have measured the rate of depletion of the lake's surface water. However, the contribution of the increasing high temperatures in the region which is also a compounding factor has received little attention. In this study, an assessment of the changes in surface water extent of Lake Chad from 1973-2017 was carried out through a land cover analysis. The potential influence of the rising land surface temperatures on the water losses was also studied. The extraction of the land cover was done using maximum likelihood classification. The results show that between 1973 and 1987, the lake lost 12,796.81km(2) of its surface water area. This period coincided with a season of drought and dry seasons reported to have occurred in the lake's area during the 1970s. Between 1987 and 2003, average temperature rise and change in surface water area was +1.54 degrees C and +962.71km(2) respectively. Between 2003 and 2017, average temperature rise and change in surface water area was +3.69 degrees C and -25.17km(2) respectively. These results provide further evidence of the alarming rate of water loss in the lake's environment, and suggest a link between rising land surface temperatures and diminution of the lake's water. The findings inform efforts directed at addressing the ecological problem facing the lake.

TI Evaluation of the surface water and sediment quality in the Duger basin
   (Burdur, Turkey) using multivariate statistical analyses and
   identification of heavy metals
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB The study aims to determine the chemical contents of the surface water of the Duger Creek and the sediments of the Duger basin, which feeds the Burdur Lake, the correlation between these contents, the potential ecological risks of these contents, the toxic heavy metal contents, and their spatial distribution by using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy method. The Duger basin, which has been selected as the study area, is located on the streams feeding the Burdur Lake, which has been determined as the Ramsar area in Turkey. Burdur Lake has a key role in the ecological balance due to its biological diversity, characteristic animal/plant fauna since it provides a suitable area for seasonal migration of waterfowl. Considering all these functions, the surface water and sediment quality of the Duger basin, which is located in the streams feeding Burdur Lake, is critical. In this study, elemental compositions of 20 water and 20 sediment samples collected from the Duger basin were determined by using the XRF spectroscopy method. Many elements that may have toxicological characteristics in terms of human and environmental health have been detected in the surface water and sediment samples from the Duger basin. These elements were found to have the following average values: Al (60.09 mg/L), Co (3.35 mg/L), Zn (3.35 mg/L), Cu (2.21 mg/L), Cr (0.14 mg/L). It is interpreted that they may be toxic because they exceed the limits specified in WHO 2004. In this context, the surface water in the Duger basin, which feeds the Burdur Lake, must be filtered before using it as drinking water or for agricultural and livestock purposes. New strategic planning is suggested to ensure the sustainability of the basin's surface water quality.

TI Interaction of Climate Change and Anthropogenic Activity on the
   Spatiotemporal Changes of Surface Water Area in Horqin Sandy Land, China
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Surface water dynamics are sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic activity, and they exert important feedback to the above two processes. However, it is unclear how climate and human activity affect surface water variation, especially in semi-arid regions, such as Horqin Sandy Land (HQSL), a typical part of the fragile region for intensive interaction of climate and land use change in northern China. We investigated the changes of spatiotemporal distribution and the influence of climatic and anthropogenic factors on Surface Water Area (SWA) in HQSL. There are 5933 Landsat images used in this research, which were processed on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform to extract water bodies by vegetation index and water index method. The results revealed that the area and number of water bodies showed a significant decrease in HQSL from 1985 to 2020. Spatially, the SWA experienced different amplitudes of variation in the Animal Husbandry Dominated Region (AHDR) and in the Agriculture Dominated Region (ADR) during two periods; many water bodies even dried up and disappeared in HQSL. Hierarchical partitioning analysis showed that the SWA of both regions was primarily influenced by climatic factors during the pre-change period (1985-2000; the mutation occurred in 2000), and human activity has become more and more significantly important during the post-change period (2001-2020). Thus, it is predictable that SWA variation in the following decades will be influenced by the interaction of climate change and human activity, even more by the later in HQSL, and the social sectors have to improve their ability to adapt to climate change by modifying land use strategy and techniques toward the sustainable development of water resources.

AB Groundwater quality plays a vital role in the safety of water supply. To assess groundwater quality in Quanzhou coastal area, a total of 183 groundwater samples were collected from shallow and deep wells in the area. Results of the study reveal that the main pollutants in Quanzhou coastal area are NO3-, NO2-, and NH4+. The values of pH vary from 4.05 to 7.85. About 3% of groundwater is very hard and 2% is highly mineralized. The high concentrations of Cl-, SO42-, F-, Mn, and Zn occur in discrete sites. The main causes are human activities. The other important reason is of geologic origin such as F- and Mn. This paper also concludes that there is a significant connection between surface water and groundwater quality from the data analysis of highNH(4)(+), Fe, and Mn concentrations. It is suggested that groundwater in the coastal regions should be pay more attention for sustainable use and the safety of surface water supply.

TI Long-Term and Bimonthly Estimation of Lake Water Extent Using Google
   Earth Engine and Landsat Data
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Lakes are one of the most important parts of the terrestrial hydrosphere. The long-term series of lake area dynamic data with high spatial-temporal resolution is of great significance to the study of global change of the water environment. Satellite observations (such as Landsat) have provided images since the 1970s, but there were challenges for the construction of long-term sequences of lake area on a monthly temporal scale. We proposed a temporal-spatial interpolation and rule-based (TSIRB) approach on the Google Earth Engine, which aims to achieve automatic water extraction and bimonthly sequence construction of lake area. There are three main steps of this method which include bimonthly image sequence construction, automatic water extraction, and anomaly rectification. We applied the TSIRB method to five typical lakes (covering salt lakes, river lagoons, and plateau alpine lakes), and constructed the bimonthly surface water dataset (BSWD) from 1987 to 2020. The accuracy assessment that was based on a confusion matrix and random sampling showed that the average overall accuracy (OA) of water extraction was 96.6%, and the average Kappa was 0.90. The BSWD sequence was compared with the lake water level observation data, and the results show that the BSWD data is closely correlated with the water level observation sequence, with correlation coefficient greater than 0.87. The BSWD improves the hollows in the global surface water (GSW) monthly data and has advantages in the temporal continuity of surface water data. The BSWD can provide a 30-m-scale and bimonthly series of surface water for more than 30 years, which shows good value for the long-term dynamic monitoring of lakes, especially in areas that are lacking in situ surveying data.

The analysis was targeted at different levels: detailed (individual active substances, individual agricultural crops, civil land-use types, hydrological catchment basins) and globally covering agricultural use, non-agricultural use (some civil sectors) and recreational shipping. The results can be used for the (re)design of environmental monitoring programmes of pesticides in surface waters and for the development of region based policies towards sustainable pesticide use.

TI Spatial Distribution of Risk Factors for Cryptosporidium Spp. Transport
   in an Irish Catchment
SO WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
AB Cryptosporidium spp. has become a major public health concern in many parts of the globe, including Ireland, as a result of recent reported waterborne outbreaks of Cryptosporidiosis. Continuous monitoring of Cryptosporidium spp. in water supplies is not feasible, so a risk-forecasting approach is required. This study reports a globally applicable approach for evaluating the spatial variation in relative risk of contaminating surface water by Cryptosporidium spp. based on a risk potential index (RPI) as an indicator of the potential pollution of surface water. The RPI is predicted by readily available data on land use, rainfall, soil type, slope, soil moisture deficit, and distance from water course. A small catchment in County Meath, Ireland, was chosen to illustrate the analysis of the approach. Data for the study area were digitized and rectified using surveyed ground control points to capture each of the RPI factors, field boundaries, and land use. The six parameters were classified and assigned a relative risk score out of 5. A Geographic Information Systems overlay analysis then was used to calculate a cumulative relative risk score for each month of the year. The analysis indicated that April and June experienced a relatively low risk of Cryptosporidium spp. transport compared with other months of the year. June had the least risk, because more than 98% of the catchment was estimated to be of low or moderate risk (RPI ranges = 0 to 2). December had the highest risk of Cryptosporidium spp. transport, because approximately 20% of the catchment area had a moderately high to very high risk (RPI ranges = 2 to 5). The study also made an attempt to reduce the risk of contaminating surface water by alternative land-use practice and relocating the field boundaries. The study demonstrated a semi-quantitative and readily implemented method for using spatial risk assessment for planning land management to reduce the risk of surface water contamination by Cryptosporidium spp. from agricultural sources. The approach could be used in any catchment with similar hydrological characteristics subject to a surface water pathogen contamination risk from grazing livestock. Water Environ. Res., 82, 750 (2010).

TI Reducing uncertainty of karst aquifer modeling with complementary
   hydrological observations for the sustainable management of groundwater
   resources
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB A quantitative estimation of the sustainability of groundwater resources is a challenge for water supply in most regions of the world. Sustainability can be estimated through numerical simulation, but uncertainty of models somehow limits the reliability of models' predictions. To overcome this limitation, we explore how parametric and predictive uncertainties is reduced by adding complementary groundwater and surface water dynamics data to a lumped parameter model. This is illustrated with the example of a Mediterranean karst hydrosystem pumped at high flow rate (similar to 1 m(3) s(-1)) to supply water to about 350,000 habitants. A lumped parameter model was set up to simulate spring discharge, water table levels and surface water discharge measured within this karst hydrosystem over a 40 year period. Then, a parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification, based on groundwater discharge, water table levels and surface water discharge observations, was conducted with a Bayesian approach. Our study illustrates how the consideration of complementary hydrological data allows reducing parametric and predictive uncertainty and improving model performance. The model is then applied to assess the impact of an increasing groundwater abstraction according to different prospective scenarios, with a focus on the storage and dynamic of flux between the different compartments of the karst hydrosystem. Based on simulation results and related predictive uncertainty, a groundwater abstraction threshold, which must not be exceeded for a sustainable management of the groundwater resource, is determined.

TI Sea surface water variability during the Mid-Brunhes inferred from
   calcareous plankton in the western Mediterranean (ODP Site 975)
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB Planktonic foraminifera and calcareous nannoplankton were analyzed in core Ocean Drilling Program Site 975, located in the western Mediterranean, in order to study their response to environmental changes across the Mid-Brunhes interval and specifically through Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 15 and 8 (ca. 650-230 ka). Multivariate analysis of assemblage composition revealed that the calcareous plankton dynamics were mainly driven by surface water temperatures both on glacial-interglacial and stadial-interstadial time scales. Throughout the studied interval, foraminiferal and nannoplankton assemblages responded to environmental forcing in concert, except during MIS 15, when multiple environmental factors appear to have been superimposed on the otherwise dominating effect of temperature variability. Sea surface temperature (SST) has been estimated from planktonic foraminiferal assemblages using the artificial neural networks method pointing out relevant seasonal variations through the record. Our reconstructions reveal that calcareous plankton assemblages also responded to other environmental factors than temperature, including modification in surface water stratification, nutrient availability and detrital input. Specifically, a more stable, stratified water column seems to have accompanied the interval through MIS 15-13. On the other hand, across the Mid-Brunhes interval, from MIS 12 onwards, the enhanced glacial strength affected both planktonic foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils: planktonic foraminifera indicate that mixed and productive surface waters developed during glacials and stadials, accompanied by episodes of increased detrital input as suggested by calcareous nannoplankton assemblages. Enhanced food availability was likely driven by wind induced upwelling and/or by continental coastal input during dry conditions persisting in the Mediterranean region and over North Africa. Finally, spectral and wavelet analyses of calcareous plankton time series allowed to identify the pattern of periodic response of the plankton at Milankovitch cycles and, in some cases, at millennial variability. The dominant 100 lcyr periodicity recorded in surface water temperature proxies clearly reflects a major response of the planktonic community to the global glacial-interglacial climate pattern. High-frequency variation (similar to 5-8, similar to 11-13 icy) of surface water temperature proxies and of selected taxa abundance highlights the occurrence of millennial-scale instability superimposed on the paleoenvironmental modifications occurring through the Mid-Brunhes interval climate transition. This framework accounts for the occurrence of different surface water dynamics across the Mid-Brunhes interval and is in favor of the hypothesis that the millennial scale surface water temperature variations are modulated by the harmonics of the precession forcing.

TI The suitability of surface waters from small west-flowing rivers for
   drinking, irrigation, and aquatic life from a global biodiversity
   hotspot (Western Ghats, India)
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The present study provides surface water types and water quality indices (WQI) for 70 large coastal rivers of the Western Ghats (WG). Irrespective of seasons and lithology, concentration of cations (Ca2+ > Na+ > Mg2+ > K+) and anions (HCO3- > Cl- >SO42- > NO3- > PO43-) follow a typical trend all along the coast. The WG rivers can broadly be classified as calcium-bicarbonate-chloride (Ca2+-HCO3--Cl-) type. Pearson correlation analysis of major ions demonstrates natural sources influence on the riverine water composition across the WG region. Gibbs plot suggests water composition of these rivers is the result of the interaction of rock and precipitation. It means that ionic contributions from precipitation and chemical weathering of rock-forming minerals largely determine surface water quality. This biodiversity hotspot is facing high population pressure and anthropogenic activities. Despite it, quantitatively, all the physical parameters and chemical constituents are within the permissible limits of the World Health Organization (WHO) and Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), thus making it suitable for drinking and domestic purposes. About 86% of the surface water samples are found to be suitable for irrigation (KR < 1) in non-monsoon seasons. Rivers near to Goa coast are only found unsuitable (KR > 1) for irrigation exclusively during non-monsoon seasons. From the majority of the calculated indices, it may be inferred that the river waters draining from the WG region are suitable for irrigation. Overall, the calculated WQI for studied rivers showed excellent to good water quality for drinking, agriculture, and aquatic life in monsoon seasons, which are then ranked from good to marginal in non-monsoon seasons.

TI Interbasin underflow between closed Altiplano Basins in Chile
SO GROUND WATER
AB Interbasin ground water movement of 200 to 240 L/sec occurs as underflow beneath a mountainous surface water divide separating the topographically higher Salar de Michincha from the topographically lower Salar de Coposa internally drained basins in the Altiplano of northern Chile. Salt-encrusted flats (salars) and saline lakes occur on the lowest parts of the basin floors and comprise the principal evaporative discharge areas for the basins. Because a surface water divide separates the basins, surface water drainage boundaries do not coincide with ground water drainage boundaries. In the region, interbasin ground water movement is usually not recognized, but occurs for selected basins, and at places is an important component of ground water budgets. With increasing development of water for mining industry and potential exportation of ground water from the Altiplano for use at coastal cities, demonstration and quantification of interbasin movement is important for assessment of sustainable ground water development in a region of extreme aridity. Recognition and quantification of interbasin ground water underflow will assist in management of ground water resources in the and Chilean Altiplano environment.

TI New Insights into the Stability of Silver Sulfide Nanoparticles in
   Surface Water: Dissolution through Hypochlorite Oxidation
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Silver sulfide nanoparticles (Ag(2)SNPs) are considered to be stable in the environment due to the extreme low solubility of Ag2S (K-sp: 6.3x10(-50)). Little is known about the stability of Ag(2)SNPs in surface water disinfected with aqueous chlorine, one of the globally most used disinfectants. Our results suggested that both uncoated and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated Ag(2)SNPs (100 mu g/L) underwent dissolution in surface water disinfected with aqueous chlorine at a dose of 4 mg/L, showing the highest dissolved silver ion concentrations of 22.3 and 10.5 mu g/L within 45 min, respectively. The natural organic matter (NOM) and dissolved oxygen (DO) posed effects on the Ag(2)SNPs dissolution by chlorine; NOM accelerated Ag(2)SNPs dissolution while DO reduced the rate and extent of Ag(2)SNPs dissolution. We further demonstrated that Ag(2)SNPs dissolution was primarily attributed to active oxidative substances including hydroxyl radical and H2O2 originating from the hypochlorite oxidation. Additionally, water containing Ag(2)SNPs disinfected with hypochlorite showed stronger interference on the zebra fish (Danio rerio) embryo hatching than Ag(2)SNPs and hypochlorite on their own. This work documented that Ag(2)SNPs could undergo dissolution in surface water through hypochlorite oxidation, posing potential risks to aquatic organisms, and therefore showed new insights into the stability of Ag(2)SNPs in natural environment.

TI Developing the greatest Blue Economy: Water productivity, fresh water
   depletion, and virtual water trade in the Great Lakes basin
SO EARTHS FUTURE
AB The Great Lakes basin hosts the world's most abundant surface fresh water reserve. Historically an industrial and natural resource powerhouse, the region has suffered economic stagnation in recent decades. Meanwhile, growing water resource scarcity around the world is creating pressure on water-intensive human activities. This situation creates the potential for the Great Lakes region to sustainably utilize its relative water wealth for economic benefit. We combine economic production and trade datasets with water consumption data and models of surface water depletion in the region. We find that, on average, the current economy does not create significant impacts on surface waters, but there is some risk that unregulated large water uses can create environmental flow impacts if they are developed in the wrong locations. Water uses drawing on deep groundwater or the Great Lakes themselves are unlikely to create a significant depletion, and discharge of groundwater withdrawals to surface waters offsets most surface water depletion. This relative abundance of surface water means that science-based management of large water uses to avoid accidentally creating "hotspots" is likely to be successful in avoiding future impacts, even if water use is significantly increased. Commercial water uses are the most productive, with thermoelectric, mining, and agricultural water uses in the lowest tier of water productivity. Surprisingly for such a water-abundant economy, the region is a net importer of water-derived goods and services. This, combined with the abundance of surface water, suggests that the region's water-based economy has room to grow in the 21st century.

TI A global perspective on compositions, risks, and ecological genesis of
   antibiotic resistance genes in biofilters of drinking water treatment
   plants
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in biofilters of drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) are regarded to be a remarkable potential health risk to human. A global survey on ARGs in biofilters may help evaluate their risk features as a whole. This study aims to explore the compositions, risks, and ecological genesis of ARGs in the biofilters of DWTPs. In total, 98 metagenomes of DWTP biofilters were collected from Sequence Read Archive (SRA) of National center for Biotechnology Infor-mation (NCBI), and the main ARG types were recognized, with multidrug, bacitracin, and beta-lactam as the first three types. Source water types (surface water vs. groundwater) were found to significantly influence antibiotic resistome, overpassing biofilter media and locations. Although ARG abundances of surface water biofilters were approximately five times higher than that of groundwater biofilters, the risk pattern of ARGs was highly similar between surface water biofilters and groundwater biofilters, and up to 99.61% of the ARGs on average belong to the least risk and unassessed ranks, and only 0.23% the highest risk rank. Monobactam biosynthesis pathway and prodigiosin biosynthesis pathway, two antibiotics biosynthesis pathways, were observed to be positively correlated with several ARG types and total ARG abundance in samples of surface water and groundwater biofilters, respectively, suggesting their potential roles in ecological genesis of ARGs. Overall, the results of this study would deepen our understanding of the ARG risks in biofilters of DWTPs and shed light on their ecological genesis inside.

TI Optimizing water resources management in large river basins with
   integrated surface water-groundwater modeling: A surrogate-based
   approach
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB Integrated surface water-groundwater modeling can provide a comprehensive and coherent understanding on basin-scale water cycle, but its high computational cost has impeded its application in real-world management. This study developed a new surrogate-based approach, SOIM (Surrogate-based Optimization for Integrated surface water-groundwater Modeling), to incorporate the integrated modeling into water management optimization. Its applicability and advantages were evaluated and validated through an optimization research on the conjunctive use of surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) for irrigation in a semiarid region in northwest China. GSFLOW, an integrated SW-GW model developed by USGS, was employed. The study results show that, due to the strong and complicated SW-GW interactions, basin-scale water saving could be achieved by spatially optimizing the ratios of groundwater use in different irrigation districts. The water-saving potential essentially stems from the reduction of nonbeneficial evapotranspiration from the aqueduct system and shallow groundwater, and its magnitude largely depends on both water management schemes and hydrological conditions. Important implications for water resources management in general include: first, environmental flow regulation needs to take into account interannual variation of hydrological conditions, as well as spatial complexity of SW-GW interactions; and second, to resolve water use conflicts between upper stream and lower stream, a system approach is highly desired to reflect ecological, economic, and social concerns in water management decisions. Overall, this study highlights that surrogate-based approaches like SOIM represent a promising solution to filling the gap between complex environmental modeling and real-world management decision-making.

TI Prospective Water Balance Scenarios (2015-2035) for the Management of
   Sao Francisco River Basin, Eastern Brazil
SO WATER
AB The need for renewed and healthier water resources pushes human society to develop new management procedures that warrant provisions and that are compatible with the population and economic growth. The Sao Francisco River is one of the main surface water resources in Brazil and is facing environmental challenges that threaten its sustainability. In the scope of growing conflicts over water resources in the Sao Francisco River Basin, the present research applied surface and groundwater balances for the current situation and for three prospective water demand scenarios (a pessimistic, an optimistic and an equilibrated) referring to 2025 and 2035, considering the multiple uses of the basin. For the surface water balance, the AcquaNet Decision Support System was used, whereas for the groundwater balance, the relationship between the withdrawal flow for consumptive uses and the exploitable flow was applied. The results evidenced that there are scenarios in which the available surface water resources will not be sufficient to satisfy the demanded projections. The groundwater balance was characterized as more favourable; however, the lack of knowledge creates uncertainties about these resources. Beyond its limitations, research was able to define geographical water availability and balance, allowing the indication of precise management procedures.

TI Changing water resources study using GIS and spatial model - A case
   study of Bhatar Block, district Burdwan, West Bengal, India
SO JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
AB Markov chains have been used to model spatial changes in a variety of spheres. Changes in social situations, economic standards, natural resource availability, and even weather conditions have been explored and predicted using Markov Random Function (MRF) and Markov Random Chains (MRC). In this section, we try to use data of Mahata village of Bhatar Block, extracted from GIS based maps/images in a MRC to obtain present transition probabilities and predict future changes. The village is facing the problem of decreasing the water table and at the same time the number of surface water bodies is also decreasing. This is a serious situation for the development of the agricultural activities in general and at the same time it poses threat to the human habitation of the village in the long run. The average depth of the ground water table from ground level increased from 8 meter to 15 meter within the last 10 years. The threat is coming from the changes in land use and land cover, especially due to substantial extension of agricultural activities which is expanding at a very fast rate. Increasing population is also demanding more lands for settlement and industrial uses. The surface water bodies i.e. the ponds etc. are used for such intensive irrigation purposes. As a result the surface water bodies depletes before the onset of summer. The cultivators use those dried up ponds or surface water bodies for agricultural purposes also. There is thus a serious trend to convert the surface water bodies into the agricultural land. It is estimated using MRC, that in next 25 years, the number of surface water bodies will deplete by 50% in the agriculturally active Bhatar PS at the current rates of depletion. Shifting to less water needy crops, prevention of LULC conversion, and water harvesting would provide some solace to the situation.

AB The main goal of this study is to compare the concentrations of anionic synthetic surfactants (ASS) in drinking and surface waters in Armenia and to explore possible relationship with diseases of the skin and digestive system. Surfactants are widely employed in numerous field of the economy, are in contact with the entire population throughout life and can be harmful to human health.The samples of drinking and surface waters (n = 144) were collected in Kotayk province to analyze ASS concentrations, physicochemical parameters and phytotoxic activity. The prevalence of diseases was analyzed for different population groups. ASS concentrations in surface waters were significantly higher in summer compared to spring (p = 0.006). In drinking water, concentrations were also higher in summer, but not significantly. In surface waters, ASS levels were 2.4-3 times higher compared to drinking (p = 0.03) and exceeded the permissible limit by 1.4-2.9 times in summer and fall. No phytotoxic activity and differences in both classes of diseases and age groups were revealed. The determination of ASS in both surface and drinking waters with the same trend showed their interrelation to a certain extent. This study provides important information for future research and action which will contribute to the sustainable development of local communities.

TI Constraining groundwater discharge in a large watershed: Integrated
   isotopic, hydraulic, and thermal data from the Canadian shield
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB The objective of this study is to evaluate the pattern and rate of groundwater discharge in a large, regulated fractured rock watershed using novel and standard methods that are independent of base flow recession. Understanding the rate and pattern of groundwater discharge to surface water bodies is critical for watershed budgets, as a proxy for recharge rates, and for protecting the ecological integrity of lake and river ecosystems. The Tay River is a low-gradient, warm-water river that flows over exposed and fractured bedrock or a thin veneer of coarse-grained sediments. Natural conservative (delta H-2, delta O-18, Cl, and specific conductance), radioactive (Rn-222), and thermal tracers are integrated with streamflow measurements and a steady state advective model to delimit the discharge locations and quantify the discharge fluxes to lakes, wetlands, creeks, and the Tay River. The groundwater discharge rates to most surface water body types are low, indicating that the groundwater and surface water system may be largely decoupled in this watershed compared to watersheds underlain by porous media. Groundwater discharge is distributed across the watershed rather than localized around lineaments or high-density zones of exposed brittle fractures. The results improve our understanding of the rate, localization, and conceptualization of discharge in a large, fractured rock watershed. Applying hydraulic, isotopic, or chemical hydrograph separation techniques would be difficult because the groundwater discharge "signal" is small compared to the "background" surface water inflows or volumes of the surface water bodies. Although this study focuses on a large watershed underlain by fractured bedrock, the methodology developed is transferable to any large regulated or unregulated watershed. The low groundwater discharge rates have significant implications for the ecology, sustainability, and management of large, crystalline watersheds.

SO QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF GROUNDWATER AND SURFACE WATER INTERACTIONS IN
   THE HAILIUTU RIVER BASIN, ERDOS PLATEAU, CHINA
AB The interactions between groundwater and surface water have been significantly affected by human activities in the semi-arid Hailiutu Catchment. A number of methods were used to investigate spatial and temporal interactions between groundwater and surface water. The isotopic and chemical analysis of surface water and groundwater samples indentified groundwater discharges to the river along the Hailiutu River. The mass balance equations were employed to estimate groundwater seepage rates along the river using the chemical profiles. The hydrograph separation method was used to estimate temporal variations of groundwater discharges to the river. A numerical groundwater model was constructed to simulate groundwater discharges along the river and analyze effects of water use in the catchment. The simulated seepage rates along the river compare reasonably well with the seepage estimates with the chemical profile in 2012. The impacts of human activities for river water diversion and groundwater abstraction on the river discharge were analyzed by calculating the differences between the simulated natural groundwater discharge and the measured river discharge. The water use in the Hailiutu River was increased from 1986 to 1991, reached its highest level from 1992 to 2000, and decreased from 2001 onwards. The reduction of river discharge might have negative impacts on the riparian ecosystem and the water availability for downstream users. The interactions between groundwater and surface water as well as the consequences of human impacts should be taken into account when implementing sustainable water resources management in the Hailiutu Catchment.

TI High-Performance Capacitive Deionization and Killing Microorganism in
   Surface-Water by ZIF-9 Derived Carbon Composites
SO SMALL METHODS
AB The protection and regeneration of the water environment is currently one of the most critical concerns for the sustainable development of human society. To solve the water crisis, the use of capacitive deionization (CDI) technology to extract fresh-water that is suitable for human consumption from abundant surface-water is a feasible solution. In this work, a cobalt benzimidazole frameworks (ZIF-9) derived carbon composites with a unique quasi-microcubic morphology is synthesized and used the as-prepared materials as an electrode material for the CDI. Interestingly, the ZIF-9 derived carbon composites exhibit an impressive desalination capacity of 55.4 mg g(-1) and can be reused. Measurements in surface-water (Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, Slender West Lake, Initial rainwater, Rain water) show that this CDI technology based on ZIF-9 derived carbon composites not only has a strong adsorption effect on metal ions but also can remarkably kill microorganisms. The results show that the technology can effectively kill bacteria (Escherichia coli and Bacillus) and algae with 95% and 91.7% inhibition rates, respectively. This work provides a valuable example for the use of metal-organic framework-derived carbon composites as high-performance electrode materials of CDI and opens a new direction for promoting the application of CDI in surface-water.

TI A type-2 fuzzy interval programming approach for conjunctive use of
   surface water and groundwater under uncertainty
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB In this study, a type-2 fuzzy interval programming (T2FIP) method is developed for conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater under uncertainty. T2FIP can effectively tackle uncertainties expressed as a hybrid of type-2 fuzzy sets and interval numbers. In T2FIP, tradeoff between system benefit and system reliability can be analyzed to obtain the practical modeling outputs. Solution method based on interactive algorithm and type reduction technique is proposed to transform fuzzy-interval constraint into its deterministic equivalents. The T2FIP method is then applied to conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater in the Zhangweinan River Basin, China. Scenarios associated with different groundwater utilization ratios are examined to help generate the optimal conjunctive water use pattern. Results show that increased groundwater utilization ratio could lead to increased crop area and system benefit; however, when the utilization ratio of groundwater for irrigation increases to 50%, the system benefit would not increase. Results reveal that, for arid and semi-arid regions, effective conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater is critical for guaranteeing the agricultural sustainability. These findings can help identify desired decision alternatives among crop planning, agricultural irrigation, and groundwater utilization with a maximized system benefit and a minimized system-failure risk.

TI Selected technology-critical elements as indicators of anthropogenic
   contamination of surface water and suspended solids on the example of
   the Biala Przemsza River (Poland)
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Pollution of surface waters from anthropogenic activities is a global problem, affecting natural ecosystems, having a large impact on the life and health of living organisms. The development of mining and metallurgic industries of Pb and Zn ores in the Biala Przemsza cachment area has had a strong influence on the surface waters and suspended solids. This paper proposes the use of selected critical elements such as Tl, Te, Ga, Ge and In as indicators of anthropogenic pollution of surface waters and suspended solids on the example of the Biala Przemsza River. The impact of strongly anthropogenic urban-industrial catchment on the temporal and spatial distribution of the selected TCEs content in the water and suspension of the Biala Przemsza River depending on the oxygen, pH and Eh conditions is presented. Research has shown that selected critical elements such as Te, Ge, and In can be indicators of anthropogenic pollution of surface waters. In the case of the Biala Przemsza River, elements such as Ga and Tl cannot be indicators of anthropogenic pollution due to their presence in the zinc and lead ore deposits occurring in the river basin. Correlation matrices showed significant relationships between the selected TCEs and other water parameters. The calculated water pollution indices confirmed that the Biala Przemsza River is the most polluted in the last three sampling points.

TI Urban surface water quality and the potential of phytoremediation to
   improve water quality in peri-urban and urban areas in Sub-Saharan
   Africa - a review
SO WATER SUPPLY
AB In 2017, 400 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) were still using unimproved drinking water sources, 80 million of whom relied on untreated surface water. Urban areas are vastly expanding all over the continent and many larger cities in SSA struggle to provide safely managed drinking water. Phytoremediation implemented in constructed wetlands (CWs) is a low-cost and sustainable alternative to highly costly and energy consuming wastewater treatment plants. In addition, CWs offer the potential to be integrated into farming and aqua-culture systems and can therefore improve food quality and production. The most prominent pollutants in urban SSA surface waters and the pollutant removal efficiencies for microbial and chemical contaminations of different plant species were identified from the literature and the accumulation rates for Pb, Cr, and Cd were compared to each other. A strong focus was given to studies conducted in SSA or other (sub)tropical regions. This review identified a range of potential phytoremediators to treat contaminated surface water and highlights the need for further in-situ studies in SSA. Plant species such as Lemna minor, Ipomoea aquatica, Spirodela polyrhiza and Brachiaria mutica show a high potential to phytoremediate the heavy metals Pb, Cr and Cd from surface water.

TI Conjunctive Water Management for Agriculture With Groundwater Salinity
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB Salt accumulations in aquifers significantly affect and transform the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater supporting irrigated agriculture. Salt accumulates in aquifers under many semi-arid irrigated lands where pumping has lowered water levels enough to prevent drainage of saline groundwater from the basin. This paper provides new insights into optimal conjunctive management of groundwater pumping, recharge, surface water, and cropping patterns with groundwater salinity and hydrologic variability in an irrigated semi-arid region, such as California's western San Joaquin Valley, reducing agricultural crop yields and revenues. A two-stage stochastic quadratic model explores this problem to prescribe economically optimal crop mix and conjunctive water operation policies over a 10-year period with probabilistic annual surface water availability, considering groundwater salinity's harm to crop yields. At low groundwater salinity, agricultural conjunctive use usually pumps most groundwater in drier years, supplied by additional recharge in wetter years. In contrast, at higher groundwater salinity, optimal conjunctive use pumps less in drier years while pumping more in wetter years, when more surface water allows more dilution of saltier groundwater. Reduced pumping in drier years substantially reduces a region's ability to support higher-value perennial crops and reduces or eliminates lower-value annual crops in dry years. Artificial recharge with fresh surface water in wetter years can have economic value from slowing groundwater salination which allows more groundwater use in drier years.

TI Estimating Exploitable Groundwater Amount in Musimcheon Watershed by
   Using an Integrated Surface Water-Groundwater Model
SO ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY
AB In Korea, groundwater management has been conducted based on the estimation of annual average of groundwater recharge. Since groundwater recharge and surface water-groundwater interactions show spatiotemporal variation, continuous monitoring and dynamic analysis must be carried out to evaluate the sustainability of groundwater resources. In this study, SWAT-MODFLOW, an integrated surface water-groundwater model was used to analyze surface-groundwater interactions for various groundwater pumping scenarios in Musimcheon watershed. When current usage is applied, the baseflow reduction is about 16%, and annual averaged storage reduction is about 27 mm for whole watershed. As a holistic approach to groundwater sustainability considers the hydrological, ecological, socioeconomic, technological aspects of groundwater utilization, the exploitable groundwater should be determined by physical analysis as well as social compromise in a community.

TI Spatial assessment of water quality in peripheral rivers of Dhaka city
   for optimal relocation of water intake point
SO WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB In order to meet the ever increasing demand of drinking water, Dhaka Water Supply Authority (DWASA) of Bangladesh has installed a number of deep tube wells that tap the upper aquifers. However, in most parts of the city, the current groundwater abstraction exceeds the recharge rate, causing the groundwater to be mined systematically and be depleted of its reserve. Thus, there is an urgent need to alleviate the demand on the upper aquifers and explore more sustainable sources to augment the present water supply. This implies a conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water in order to maintain the balance between anthropogenic demand and water's natural availability. However, the surface water along these peripheral rivers is known to be highly polluted due to municipal and industrial untreated wastewaters that are discharged. This study analyzes the present water quality scenario along the surrounding rivers of Dhaka City pertaining to a 2-day field survey during the dry season of 2005. It uses a Geographic Information System (GIS) as a tool to arrive at a solution for relocation of the current intake point for surface water withdrawal. Derivation of water quality profiles (as a function of distance) along the downstream and upstream reaches of the current intake location indicated that a new location 12 km upstream of the present intake point could potentially be ideal for withdrawing surface water during the monsoon season. Such a proposed location was considered optimal due to the anticipated moderate construction costs of the transmission system that would be necessary to draw water to the current treatment plant. The study lays the foundations for the Dhaka City planners and designers to make a qualitative resource assessment of surface water. Such an assessment can eventually evolve to a long-term monitoring system of water supply sources for any city using GIS tools.

TI Global scanning of antihistamines in the environment: Analysis of
   occurrence and hazards in aquatic systems
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Concentration of the global population is increasingly occurring in megacities and other developing regions, where access to medicines is increasing more rapidly than waste management systems are implemented. Because freshwater and coastal systems are influenced by wastewater effluent discharges of differential quality, exposures in aquatic systems must be considered. Here, we performed a global scanning assessment of antihistamines(AHs), a common class of medicines, in surface waters and effluents. Antihistamines were identified, literature occurrence and ecotox-icology data on AHs collated, therapeutichazardvalues(THVs) calculated, and environmental exposure distributions (EEDs) of AHs compared to ecotoxicity thresholds and drug specific THVs to estimate hazards in surface waters and effluents. Literature searches of 62 different AHs in environmental matrices identified 111 unique occurrence publications of 24 specific AHs, largely from Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America. However, the majority of surface water (63%) and effluent (85%) observations were from Europe and North America, which highlights relatively limited information from many regions, including developing countries and rapidly urbanizing are asin Africa, Latin America and Asia. Less than 10% of all observations were for estuarine or marine systems, though the majority of human populations reside close to coastal habitats. EED 5th and 95th centiles for all AHs were 2 and 212 ng/L in surface water, 5 and 1308 ng/L in effluent and 6 and 4287 ng/L in influent, respectively. Unfortunately, global hazards and risks of AHs to non-target species remain poorly understood. However, loratadine observations in surface waters exceeded a THV without an uncertainty factor 40% of the time, indicating future research is needed to understand aquatic toxicology, hazards and risks as sociated with this AH. This unique global scanning study further illustrates the utility of global asessments of pharmaceuticals and other contaminants to identify chemicals requiring toxicology study and regions where environmental monitoring, assessment and management efforts appear limited and necessary.

AB Surface water quality monitoring (SWQM) provides essential information for water environmental protection. However, SWQM is costly and limited in terms of equipment and sites. The global popularity of social media and intelligent mobile devices with GPS and photography functions allows citizens to monitor surface water quality. This study aims to propose a method for SWQM using social media platforms. Specifically, a WeChat-based application platform is built to collect water quality reports from volunteers, which have been proven valuable for water quality monitoring. The methods for data screening and volunteer recruitment are discussed based on the collected reports. The proposed methods provide a framework for collecting water quality data from citizens and offer a primary foundation for big data analysis in future research.

TI Seasonal quality variation and environmental risks associated with the
   consumption of surface water: implication from the Landzun Stream, Bida
   Nigeria
SO HELIYON
AB Water constitutes a major environmental and public health concerns worldwide. A large proportion of global water consumption is sourced from surface water. The dependency level on surface water is higher in developing countries, especially in rural-to-semi-urban areas, where subsurface water is not accessible. Presented in this paper is a spatiotemporal and hydrochemical quality assessment of the spring-originated Landzun Stream in Bida, Nigeria; which is usually consumed in its untreated state. Water samples were systematically collected in eighteen locations along the stream channel in both rainy and dry seasons at an equidistance interval of 500m. On-site and laboratory measurement of important physical and hydrochemical parameters were carried out using standard procedures. Water temperature in the rainy season (34-37 degrees C) slightly exceeds measured values in the dry season (29-33 degrees C). 72.22% (rainy) and 83.33% (dry) of collected samples did not meet the odourless requirement for drinking water. Similarly, estimated percentages of 66.67 and 94.44 of collected samples in rainy and dry seasons respectively have a taste. Contrary to data in the rainy season, 89%, 11%, 67% and 56% of the dry season's samples were enriched in magnesium (Mg), lead (Pb), potassium (K) and iron (Fe) respectively above the 2018 World Health Organisation guidelines for drinking water. This study further established that seasonal variation plays a major role in altering the aesthetic surface water quality. The intake of untreated surface water is a vehicle for potential water-borne diseases and allergies, hence alternative sources of drinking water for the populace dependent on the Landzun Stream is recommended to reduce risks and possible dangers of consuming the stream water.

TI Detecting land surface water changes in the Upper Mzingwane
   sub-catchment using remotely sensed data
SO AQUA-WATER INFRASTRUCTURE ECOSYSTEMS AND SOCIETY
AB Globally, water is acknowledged as indispensable. It is essential for both human life and environmental needs. However, surface water resources are threatened by human and climatic influences, which may result in changes in size and density. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the normalised difference water index (NDWI), modified normalised difference water index (MNDWI) and automated water extraction index (AWEI) in detecting land surface water changes using Landsat satellite data. The results showed that the AWEI performed considerably better than the MNDWI and NDWI for extracting water surface area in the Upper Mzingwane sub-catchment, with an overall accuracy of 0.93 and a kappa coefficient of 0.82. The MNDWI and NDWI had overall accuracy/kappa values of 0.88/0.74 and 0.89/0.73, respectively. The AWEI can enhance surface water features while effectively suppressing or eliminating pollution and noise from surrounding vegetation and muddy soil. NDWI/MDWI water information is often mixed with pollution noise, vegetation and muddy soil, overestimating the area of water. All the applied indices indicate a progressive loss in the surface area of the water bodies in the sub-catchment. The decrease in water surface area could be a result of degradation, as it coincided with a decrease in vegetation cover and an increase in degraded areas. Future research needs to investigate the hydrological response of the sub-catchment to the potential influence of climate, variability, change, and land use land cover (LULC) changes.

TI Groundwater- and surface water balance in aquifers of the ostliche
   Bodenwohrer Senke, Oberpfalz
SO GRUNDWASSER
AB The ostliche Bodenwohrer Senke in Oberpfalz, Bavaria, has abundant groundwater deposits in Keuper and Upper Chalk sandstones due to its special geological situation. These formations are used by a large number of water supply companies. The available groundwater was determined and a hydrological balance of the regional groundwater and surface water turnover was determined. The flow budget module of a groundwater flow model was used to differentiate three main aquifers. The isolated location of the groundwater resources within the surrounding crystalline basement causes a largely complete discharge of the groundwater into rivers and creeks at the margins of the Bodenwohrer Senke. A measurement of the surface water turnover using runoff measurements for the project period confirmed the plausibility of the model-based balance. Groundwater level measurements recorded the change in the groundwater reservoir. The individual years 2011 to 2014 deviated significantly from the mean value in both directions due to strongly changing climatic conditions. The mean value indicates a sustainable groundwater availability in the Bodenwohrer Senke. The years 2015 to 2020, on the other hand, led to falling groundwater levels and reduced runoff due to the succession of several dry years.

TI Retrospective suspect screening reveals previously ignored antibiotics,
   antifungal compounds, and metabolites in Bangladesh surface waters
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Densely populated countries in Asia, such as Bangladesh, arc considered to be major contributors to the increased occurrence of global antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Several factors make low-and middle-income countries vulnerable to increased emergence and spread of AMR in the environment including, limited regulations on antimicrobial drug use, high volume of antimicrobials used in human medicine and agricultural production, and poor wastewater management. Previous monitoring campaigns to investigate the presence of antibiotics in the aquatic environment have employed targeted analysis in which selected antibiotics are measured using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). However, this approach can miss several important contaminants that can contribute to the selective pressure that promotes maintenance and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. Nontarget analysis by suspect screening and reanalysis of stored digital data of previously ran samples can provide information on analytes that were formerly uncharacterized and may be chemicals of emerging concern (CECs). In this study, surface waters in both urban and rural sites in Bangladesh were collected and analyzed for the presence of antibiotic residues and other pharmaceuticals. Utilizing targeted analysis, the antibiotics with the highest concentrations detected were ciprofloxacin (1407 ng/L) and clarithromycin (909 ng/L). In addition, using high-resolution LC/MS/MS in the first ever application of retrospective analysis in samples from Bangladesh, additional antibiotics clindamycin, lincomycin, linezolid, metroniclazole, moxifloxacin, nalidixic acid, and sulfapyridine were detected. Prevalence of amoxicillin transformation products in surface waters was also confirmed. In addition, medicinal and agricultural antifungal compounds were frequently found in Bangladeshi surface waters. This later finding - the near ubiquity of antifungal agents in environmental samples - is of particular concern, as it may be contributing to the alarming rise of multi-drug resistant fungal (e.g. Candida auris) disease recently seen in humans throughout the world.

TI The influence of structural and functional changes on N-P-K input of
   agricultural origin and surface water quality in the upper Dunajec River
   basin in the years 1980-2010
SO GEOLOGY GEOPHYSICS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB The aim of the study was the prediction of N-P-K inputs (hereafter referred to as NPK load) from agricultural sources. The study aimed to determine relations between the structural changes and the N-P-K load (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium) fertilizer components in the upper Dunajec River basin (the Carpathian region in Poland). Analysis included the level and nature of agricultural production, the land use structure and non-agricultural factors. Multiple regression analysis was used for the development of the model. Relationships were determined in the form of regression models in the system of N-P-K load-structural parameters-land use-surface water quality. The quality of surface water was assessed in a range of concentrations of N-NO3-, N-NH4+, PO43-, Cl-, and compared to the N-P-K load that was brought to the basin from agricultural sources. Significant structural and spatial changes took place in the upper Dunajec River basin that affected many social, economic and environmental factors. Agricultural production was reduced, resulting in a decrease of area of agricultural land between the year 1980 and 2010. The most important factors influencing the changes in biogenic load of an agricultural origin were: stocking density and mineral fertilization. Both of these parameters determined the amount of N-P-K load in approx. 80-90% (not counting the use of N-P-K components by crops). Surface water quality has generally improved, only higher concentrations of chlorides were recorded in small urbanized river basins. Therefore, the chemical composition of water plays the role of a simplified indicator of structural changes. Mathematical formulas proved changes in N-P-K load depending on variations of individual influencing factors. The development of the usable space of the investigated river basin must take into account agricultural and non-agricultural factors, as well as the proportions and relationships between them. Only then might the sustainable and multifunctional development of these areas be provided.

TI Microplastic abundance, distribution and composition in water,
   sediments, and wild fish from Poyang Lake, China
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB Microplastic pollution in global aquatic environments has aroused increasing concern in recent years. In this study, the occurrence of microplastics in multiple environmental compartments was investigated in Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake of China. The abundance of microplastics was respectively 5-34 items/L for surface waters, 54-506 items/kg for sediments, and 0-18 items per individual for wild crucians (Carassius auratus). The distribution of microplastics in Poyang Lake varied heterogeneously in space, with the highest abundance being observed in the middle region of the lake for surface waters and in the northern region for sediments. Anthropogenic and topographic factors were speculated to be the major factors affecting the abundance and distribution of microplastics. The majority of the detected microplastics were found with a size of < 0.5 mm, with fibrous and coloured being the predominant characteristics. Polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) were the major polymer types of the selected plastic particles, indicating that domestic sewage and fishing activities might be the main sources of microplastics in the lake. No significant correlation was observed between microplastic abundance in surface water and sediment samples. Our results demonstrated the wide occurrence of microplastics in water, sediment and biota of the Poyang Lake, which may assist in extending our knowledge regarding microplastics pollution in inland freshwater systems.

TI Dynamic attribution of global water demand to surface water and
   groundwater resources: Effects of abstractions and return flows on river
   discharges
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
AB As human water demand is increasing worldwide, pressure on available water resources grows and their sustainable exploitation is at risk. To mimic changes in exploitation intensity and the connecting feedbacks between surface water and groundwater systems, a dynamic attribution of demand to water resources is necessary. However, current global-scale hydrological models lack the ability to do so. This study explores the dynamic attribution of water demand to simulated water availability. It accounts for essential feedbacks, such as return flows of unconsumed water and riverbed infiltration. Results show that abstractions and feedbacks strongly affect water allocation over time, particularly in irrigated areas. Also residence time of water is affected, as shown by changes in low flow magnitude, frequency, and timing. The dynamic representation of abstractions and feedbacks makes the model a suitable tool for assessing spatial and temporal impacts of changing global water demand on hydrology and water resources.

TI Importance of landscape heterogeneity in sustaining hydrologic ecosystem
   services in an agricultural watershed
SO ECOSPHERE
AB The sustainability of hydrologic ecosystem services (freshwater benefits to people generated by terrestrial ecosystems) is challenged by human modification of landscapes. However, the role of landscape heterogeneity in sustaining hydrologic services at scales relevant to landscape management decisions is poorly understood. In particular, the relative importance of landscape composition (type and proportion of land cover) and configuration (spatial arrangement of cover types) is unclear. We analyzed indicators of production of three hydrologic services (freshwater supply, surface and ground water quality) in 100 subwatersheds in an urbanizing agricultural landscape (Yahara Watershed, Wisconsin, USA) and asked: (1) How do landscape composition and configuration affect supply of hydrologic services (i.e., does spatial pattern matter)? (2) Are there opportunities for small changes in landscape pattern to produce large gains in hydrologic services? Landscape composition and configuration both affected supply of hydrologic services, but composition was consistently more important than configuration for all three services. Together landscape composition and configuration explained more variation in indicators of surface-water quality than in freshwater supply or groundwater quality (Nagelkerke/adjusted R-2 : 86%, 64%, and 39%, respectively). Surface-water quality was negatively correlated with percent cropland and positively correlated with percent forest, grassland and wetland. In addition, surface-water quality was greater in subwatersheds with higher wetland patch density, disaggregated forest patches and lower contagion. Surface-water quality responded nonlinearly to percent cropland and wetland, with greater water quality where cropland covered below 60% and/or wetland above 6% of the subwatershed. Freshwater supply was negatively correlated with percent wetland and urban cover, and positively correlated with urban edge density. Groundwater quality was negatively correlated with percent cropland and grassland, and configuration variables were unimportant. Collectively, our study suggests that altering spatial arrangement of land cover will not be sufficient to enhance hydrologic services in an agricultural landscape. Rather, the relative abundance of land cover may need to change to improve hydrologic services. Targeting subwatersheds near the cropland or wetland thresholds may offer local opportunities to enhance surface-water quality with minimal land-cover change.

TI Water quantity and quality challenges from Elephant Butte to Amistad
SO ECOSPHERE
AB Management of the Rio Grande between Elephant Butte and Amistad Reservoirs involves a number of distinct water quantity and quality challenges. These challenges arise from both "natural'' stressors, such as climate variability and geologic sources of salinization, and "human'' stressors, such as bacterial and nutrient contamination from urban storm water, agricultural return flows, and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), altered hydrology, and increasing/changing water demands. The discussion does not argue for a single approach to surface water "sustainability'' as these decisions are properly made by elected officials and decisions makers. Rather it provides an overview of the surface water system contrasting the pre-development system with the present day to help inform how the stressors mentioned above impact this resource. Current efforts to address these issues are also discussed.

TI Sustainable surface water management and green infrastructure in UK
   urban catchment planning
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Based on the analysis of impervious surface cover and water balance studies, it is argued that conventional, separately-sewered first-generation and alternative second-generation sustainable drainage systems (SUDS) cannot provide a fully sustainable surface water management approach for urban catchment planning. An extended approach based on the introduction of micro-and meso-vegetative SUDS systems into a wider green infrastructure (GI) framework is advocated to effectively address on-site and catchment urban surface water issues. The approach is based on the integrated planning implementation of street greening, with optimisation of existing biofiltration SUDS solutions, together with green roofs, downspout disconnection and sub-catchment riparian corridors to achieve a minimum 2530% canopy cover level. A leaf-out inventory procedure using GIS and satellite imagery can be employed to assess potential vegetative SUDS locations and types, and their likely impact upon the urban water cycle and receiving water health. However, there is a need to ensure that GI elements are incorporated into planning approaches and protocols for urban drainage infrastructure provision.

TI Climate influences on upper Limpopo River flow
SO WATER SA
AB This study demonstrates how the regional climate affects river flow in the upper Limpopo Valley of southern Africa (21-24.5S, 26-30E). The catchment basin receives inflow from the Crocodile, Marico, Mahalapse and Lotsane Rivers, and lies on the eastern fringe of the Kalahari plateau, known for water-deficit conditions. Different ways to represent the surface water balance are compared. The annual cycle of gains from precipitation (P) spikes upward in late summer (Jan-Mar), while losses from evaporation have a broad peak in early summer (Oct-Dec). Different formulations of the surface water balance yield a range of values from -0.21 to -1.69 mm/day, depending on how evaporation is quantified. An analysis of global climatic influences on the Limpopo River found that high flow coincides with Pacific La Nina, low pressure over the central Atlantic and local upper easterly winds that draw tropical moisture from the Mozambique Channel. There is little trend in Limpopo River flow during the study period 1959-2014; however, CMIP5 model projections exhibit a downtrend in the surface water balance. A new insight is that evaporation losses are well represented by sensible heat flux in semi-arid environments.

TI Assessment of surface water pollution in urban and industrial areas of

SO POLLUTION
AB The present study has been conducted to determine the surface water quality of urban area in Savar, Dhaka, Bangladesh by determining some water quality parameters (Transparency, Temperature, pH, EC, Eh, DO, TSS, TDS, TS, BOD5(,) COD, TOC, Cl-, Br-, SO4-2, NO3-, NO2-, PO4-3, TP, HCO3- and Total alkalinity) as well as the status of phytoplankton's community in the water from two lakes (Tiger Lake and AERE Lake) and one canal (Karnapara Canal). The water quality of the AERE Lake is better than the Tiger Lake and the Karnapara Canal. Organic Pollution Index (OPI) demonstrates that water bodies are severely polluted by organic matters in the study area. R mode Cluster Analysis (CA) reveals that the water bodies are polluted and the common sources of pollutants are anthropogenic (industrial, agricultural, municipal sewerage). The Principle Component Analysis/ Factor Analysis (PCA/FA) identifies two dominant factors, responsible for data structure, explaining 100% of total variance in the data set. The PCA agrees with CA, suggesting that multiple anthropogenic sources are responsible for the surface water quality deterioration in this area. The present study reflects the actual scenario of surface water quality of Savar urban area, thus will be helpful for the policy planers and makers to take proper management and abatement strategies for the sustainable management of water resources in urban areas of Bangladesh.

TI Temporal Patterns and Effects of Surface-Water Diversions on Daily Flows
   and Aquatic Habitats: Bega-Bemboka River, New South Wales, Australia
SO GEOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH
AB An understanding of the nature and magnitude of hydrological, physical habitat and physico-chemical effects resulting from surface-water diversions in river systems is essential for effective management of water resources. For most coastal-draining rivers in New South Wales, however, there are few data available on irrigation diversions, their hydrological impacts and environmental effects. This paper therefore presents an analysis of mean daily surface-water diversions for pasture irrigation from approximately three years of metered data and the resultant effects on daily flows and aquatic habitats in the Bega-Bemboka River. The period of analysis of the hydrological effects of irrigation diversions is extended to the full length of record (approximately five years) for gauging stations most affected by irrigation diversions, using Maintenance of Variance Extension Type 1 (MOVE. 1) modelling techniques. The annual mean, median and peak daily rates of water diversion by metered surface-water licences used to irrigate 925 ha of dairy pasture are 10.5 Ml d(-1), 7.3 Ml d(-1) and 41.5 Ml d(-1), respectively. Diversion effects on flow duration statistics are such that the measured 90th and 95th daily flow duration percentiles at the gauging station most affected by upstream irrigation diversions are equivalent to the 97th and 99th flow duration percentiles, respectively, under MOVE. 1 modelled natural flow conditions. While diversions for irrigation over the three-year data period account for only 6.6% of total flow volumes, diversions as a proportion of daily surface-water inflows increase exponentially under decreasing flow rates. Median and maximum daily diversion rates attain 91% and 118%, respectively, of total surface-water inflows to the diversion-affected reach when upstream inflows range from 15 to 20 Ml d(-1). This exponentially-increasing relationship between daily diversion rates and declining surface-water inflows suggests that 'rule of thumb' guidelines on sustainable diversion limits based on mean or median annual percentage diversion volumes need to be applied cautiously to river systems with no or limited capacity to manipulate flows to meet downstream consumptive demands.

TI Groundwater and Surface Water Availability via a Joint Simulation with a
   Double Control of Water Quantity and Ecologically Ideal Shallow
   Groundwater Depth: A Case Study on the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China
SO WATER
AB Joint assessment of groundwater-surface water resources can help develop sustainable regional water management plans for intensive agriculture. In this study, we estimated allowable groundwater and surface water quantities using a water balance model, WetSpass-GMS, for the Sanjiang Plain (10.9 x 10(4) km(2)), one of the most important grain production bases in China. We then applied a double control based on the groundwater availability and the concept of an ecologically ideal shallow groundwater depth (EISGD) to three different water use scenarios: (A) continuation of the current water use management; (B) maximal use of water resources under a double control; and (C) irrigation of 266.7 x 10(4) hectares that are suitable for rice cultivation. We found an annual allowable surface water quantity of 4.71 billion cubic meters for the region and an annual exploitable groundwater quantity of 4.65 billion cubic meters under full consideration of water requirements, i.e., sustaining river base flow, necessary riverine sediment transport, and ecological water supplies for wetlands and reservoirs. Our simulation results showed that for Scenario A, groundwater level in the region would continue falling, and that the groundwater levels in wet, normal and dry years would drop below the EISGD level in 2028, 2023 and 2019, respectively. For Scenario B, groundwater and surface water would be able to support rice paddies of 219.7 x 10(4) hectares, 212.7 x 10(4) hectares, and 209.3 x 10(4) hectares during wet, normal and dry years, respectively. For Scenario C, future demands on groundwater and surface water under wet, dry and normal years would all exceed their allowable supplies. Overall, this study indicates that integrated management plans promoting an increase of surface water use and a reduction in irrigation with groundwater should be developed for sustainable agriculture and ecological preservation on the Sanjiang Plain.

AB This study uses a phased approach to groundwater development in the Mpumalanga Province of South Africa. It is shown that the sustainable wellfield yield is easily over-estimated using short-term pump testing interpretations and simple catchment water balance calculations, not recognising surface water/groundwater interaction and riparian vegetation water use. In Phase 1, a pilot wellfield and conceptual site model were established. In Phase II the wellfield was extended to fourteen boreholes with a collective yield of about 5 Ml/day, based on the preliminary wellficld exploitation potential. A long-term pump test with an extensive monitoring program was carried out. Interpretation of these data, as well as detailed water balance calculations, base flow separation and numerical modelling, indicated that the long-term sustainable yield of the aquifer is only 1.8 Ml/day, about 35% of the original exploitation potential. Minimum, moderate and maximum abstraction scenarios are proposed, with the possibility of baseflow reduction increasing with each proposed scenario. The paper also illustrates that the best way to determine aquifer sustainable yield is to stress the aquifer over a short duration, followed by detailed data analysis.

TI Influences of Land-Use Dynamics and Surface Water Systems Interactions
   on Water-Related Infectious Diseases-A Systematic Review
SO WATER
AB Human interactions with surface water systems, through land-use dynamics, can influence the transmission of infectious water-related diseases. As a result, the aim of our study was to explore and examine the state of scientific evidence on the influences of these interactions on water-related infectious disease outcomes from a global perspective. A systematic review was conducted, using 54 peer-reviewed research articles published between 1995 and August 2019. The study revealed that there has been an increase in the number of publications since 2009; however, few of these publications (n = 6) made explicit linkages to the topic. It was found that urban and agricultural land-use changes had relatively high adverse impacts on water quality, due to high concentrations of fecal matter, heavy metals, and nutrients in surface water systems. Water systems were found as the common "vehicle" for infectious disease transmission, which in turn had linkages to sanitation and hygiene conditions. The study found explicit linkages between human-surface water interaction patterns and the transmission of water-based disease. However, weak and complex linkages were found between land-use change and the transmission of water-borne disease, due to multiple pathways and the dynamics of the other determinants of the disease. Therefore, further research studies, using interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to investigate and enhance a deeper understanding of these complexities and linkages among land use, surface water quality, and water-related infectious diseases, is crucial in developing integrated measures for sustainable water quality monitoring and diseases prevention.

TI Antibiotic and antiparasitic residues in surface water of urban rivers
   in the Red River Delta (Hanoi, Vietnam): concentrations, profiles,
   source estimation, and risk assessment
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Antibiotic residues and antimicrobial resistance in surface water are issues of global concern, especially in developing countries. In this study, the occurrence of seven antibiotics and one antiparasitic agent was determined in surface water samples collected from four rivers running through Hanoi urban area in the Red River Delta, northern Vietnam. The pharmaceuticals in water samples were analyzed by solid-phase extraction combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. The concentrations of pharmaceuticals in our samples ranged from 3050 to 16,700 (median 7800) ng/L, which were generally higher than levels found in river water from many other locations in the world. Amoxicillin, oxfendazole, and lincomycin were the most dominant and frequently detected compounds (detection rate 100%), which together accounted for 76 +/- 14% of total concentrations. Sulfacetamide and sulfamethoxazole were detected at moderate concentrations in more than two-thirds of the analyzed samples. The remaining antibiotics (i.e., azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin) were found at lower detection frequency and concentrations. Antibiotic concentrations in the water samples were not significantly different between the investigated rivers. Meanwhile, levels of pharmaceuticals in the samples collected in February 2020 were higher than those found in the remaining samples, largely due to the sharp decrease in sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin concentrations of the samples collected in March and April. Considerable ecological risks of antibiotics in surface water were estimated for some compounds such as amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin.

AB In terms of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), post-mining lakes are defined as artificial water bodies (AWB). For AWB, the WFD demands to achieve a good surface water chemical status and a "good ecological potential", the sustainable integration in the groundwater and surface water landscape, and the consideration in river basin management plans. The undertaken efforts to meet the requirements of the WFD are presented for two post-mining lakes in East Germany and Northwest Spain, respectively, that they are still in development.

TI The relationships of urbanization to surface water quality in four lakes
   of Hanyang, China
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
AB By converting rural land into urban land, urbanization impacts on surface water quality, because cities produce more pollutants than farmlands, especially heavy metals. Ways to reduce urbanization impacts on water quality are now being highlighted worldwide. Considering that land use can be a source or sink in pollution runoff, an understanding of the relationship between urbanization and surface water quality, as well as effects of specific land uses on water quality, is crucial. Corresponding management and controlling steps can then be put forward towards non-point source (NPS) pollution control and urban sustainable development. China has experienced rapid urbanization, especially since the 1980s. However, the environmental impacts of this process are not fully investigated. Hanyang, Hubei Province was selected as a typical city to study the impacts of urbanization on lake water quality. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to elucidate the correlation between different land uses and water quality indicators at both whole lake watershed and small catchment scales. The results indicated that land uses play different roles, either source or sink, in pollution flow processes. Bottomland had a negative and residential land a positive correlation to most water quality indicators, especially heavy metals. These proved to be indicative and crucial land uses in NPS pollution control. Finally, a strategy for regulating urban land uses is proposed for improving surface water quality in cities similar to Hanyang, in southern China.

CY MAY, 1999

SP Canadian Geophys Union
AB Canadian research contributions to quantity, quality and ecology of surface waters during 1995-1998 (182 items) are summarized under six headings: understanding the pristine hydrological system (49); climate variability and hydrological systems (23); streamflow data, modelling and simulation (23); regional, international and flood hydrology (31); land use effects on the hydrological system (35); and sustainability of hydrological systems (21). The most encouraging developments have occurred in increased understanding of the inter-connectedness of components of the hydrological cycle and, especially, of the links between biosphere and hydrosphere. Canadian hydrologists also have played a significant role in global environmental change research and in applied development research. The most discouraging development has been the collapse of the national water monitoring programme and the decay of integrated experimental research areas. The overall impression is that hydrology in Canada is a maturing discipline; the physical, chemical and biological components are becoming less isolated; and anthropogenic impacts on surface water are more frequently considered to fall within the purview of hydrological science. The role of hydrology in relation to sustainability is increasingly actively debated. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Occurrence and distribution of microplastics in an urban river: A case
   study in the Pearl River along Guangzhou City, China
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Microplastics, as emerging contaminants in the global environment, have become a cause for concern for both academics and the public. The present understanding of microplastic pollution is primarily focused on marine environments, and less attention has been given to freshwater environments, in particular, to urban rivers. In this study, microplastics were sampled from surface water and sediments in 14 sites located in the lower course of the Pearl River. These sampling sites are located along Guangzhou of South China, with built-up areas being the dominant land use. The abundances of microplastics in surface water and sediments ranged from 379 to 7924 items.m(-3) and 80 to 9597 items.kg(-1), respectively. Polyethylene and polypropylene were the common types of microplastics, together accounting for 64.3% and 73.8% of surface water and sediment samples, respectively. Fibers were the dominant microplastic shapes in both water and sediment samples. The abundances of microplastics varied in surface water and sediments with each site, which might be affected by multiple factors. Our results indicated that wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) could reduce microplastics from municipal sewage which was finally discharged into the Pearl River along Guangzhou.

TI Comparison of visible and multi-satellite global inundation datasets at
   high-spatial resolution
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB Several new satellite-derived and long-term surface water datasets at high-spatial resolution have recently become available at the global scale, showing different characteristics and abilities. They are either based on visible imagery from Landsat - the Global 3-second Water Body Map (G3WBM) and the Global Surface Water Explorer (GSWE) - or on the merging of passive/active microwave and visible observations - Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellite (GIEMS-D3) - that has been downscaled from a native resolution of 25 km x 25 km to the 90 m x 90 m resolution. The objective of this paper is to perform a thorough comparison of the different water surface estimates in order to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches and propose a strategy for future developments of high-resolution surface water databases. Results show that due to their very high spatial resolution (30 m) the Landsat-based datasets are well suited to retrieve open water surfaces, even at very small size. GIEMS-D3 has a better ability to detect water under vegetation and during the cloudy season, and it shows larger seasonal dynamics. However, its current version overestimates surface water extent on water-saturated soils, and due to its low original (i.e. before downscaling) spatial resolution, it is under-performing at detecting small water bodies. The permanent waters for G3WBM, GSWE, GIEMS-D3 and GLWD represent respectively: 2.76, 2.05, 3.28, and 3.04 million km(2). The transitory waters shows larger discrepancies: 0.48, 3.72, 10.39 and 8.81 million km(2).
   Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data (from ENVIronment SATellite (ENVISAT), Sentinel and soon the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT)) would be a good complementary information because they have a high nominal spatial resolution and are less sensitive to clouds than visible measurements. However, global SAR datasets are still not available due to difficulties in developing a retrieval scheme adequate at the global scale. In order to improve our estimates of global wetland extents at high resolution and over long-term records, three interim lines of action are proposed: (1) extend the temporal record of GIEMS-D3 to exploit the full time series of microwave observations (from 1978 to present), (2) develop an approach to fuse the GSWE and GIEMS-D3 datasets leveraging the strengths of both, and (3) prepare for the release of SAR global datasets.

TI Using Community Science to Reveal the Global Chemogeography of River
   Metabolomes
SO METABOLITES
AB River corridor metabolomes reflect organic matter (OM) processing that drives aquatic biogeochemical cycles. Recent work highlights the power of ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry for understanding metabolome composition and river corridor metabolism. However, there have been no studies on the global chemogeography of surface water and sediment metabolomes using ultrahigh-resolution techniques. Here, we describe a community science effort from the Worldwide Hydrobiogeochemistry Observation Network for Dynamic River Systems (WHONDRS) consortium to characterize global metabolomes in surface water and sediment that span multiple stream orders and biomes. We describe the distribution of key aspects of metabolomes including elemental groups, chemical classes, indices, and inferred biochemical transformations. We show that metabolomes significantly differ across surface water and sediment and that surface water metabolomes are more rich and variable. We also use inferred biochemical transformations to identify core metabolic processes shared among surface water and sediment. Finally, we observe significant spatial variation in sediment metabolites between rivers in the eastern and western portions of the contiguous United States. Our work not only provides a basis for understanding global patterns in river corridor biogeochemical cycles but also demonstrates that community science endeavors can enable global research projects that are unfeasible with traditional research models.

TI Literature Review: Global Neonicotinoid Insecticide Occurrence in
   Aquatic Environments
SO WATER
AB Neonicotinoids have been the most commonly used insecticides since the early 1990s. Despite their efficacy in improving crop protection and management, these agrochemicals have gained recent attention for their negative impacts on non-target species such as honeybees and aquatic invertebrates. In recent years, neonicotinoids have been detected in rivers and streams across the world. Determining and predicting the exposure potential of neonicotinoids in surface water requires a thorough understanding of their fate and transport mechanisms. Therefore, our objective was to provide a comprehensive review of neonicotinoids with a focus on their fate and transport mechanisms to and within surface waters and their occurrence in waterways throughout the world. A better understanding of fate and transport mechanisms will enable researchers to accurately predict occurrence and persistence of insecticides entering surface waters and potential exposure to non-target organisms in agricultural intensive regions. This review has direct implications on how neonicotinoids are monitored and degraded in aquatic ecosystems. Further, an improved understanding of the fate and transport of neonicotinoids aide natural resource practitioners in the development and implementation of effective best management practices to reduce the potential impact and exposure of neonicotinoids in waterways and aquatic ecosystems.

TI Antibiogram signatures of Vibrio species recovered from surface waters
   in South Western districts of Uganda: Implications for environmental
   pollution and infection control
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Reports of vibriosis and other related gastrointestinal infections have remained a recurring concern in the diverse global continent. The safety of drinking surface water and associated environmental pollution has remained a public health concern in limited resource sittings. Seen in this light, we report the antibiogram signatures of Vibrio species recovered from surface waters in the South-Western districts of Uganda. Surface water samples were col-lected for four months for Vibrio species isolation in four districts (Bushenyi-B, Mitooma-M, Rubirizi-R, and Sheema-S) using bacteria culture procedures, disc diffusion and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique. Iso-lates were characterised, and the antibiotic fingerprints were determined using PCR and nine selected antibiotics in routine use. A total of 392 Vibrio species were confirmed from the various districts (B: 172, M: 79. R: 60, S: 81), with 163 (94.77%) resistant to colistin (polymixin), 145 (84.3%) resistant to cefotaxime, 127 (73.84%) resistant to azithromycin, and 33 (19.19%) resistant to chloramphenicol among Bushenyi isolates. A similar high resistance to fluoroquinolones and carbapenem antibiotics were also recorded in other districts of the study area. A complete multiple antibiotic resistance phenotype ((M)ARPs) to the applied antibiotics (A-CTX-CXM-MEM-ATH-K-TM-C-PB-NI-CIP-NA) were also recorded among some isolates, which produced multiple antibiotic resistance indexes of 1, suggesting a high-risk source of contamination due to the usage of several antibiotics. The PCR reports also confirm ampC gene {20 (10.9%)}, beta-lactamase TEM gene (blaTEM2), {30 (10%)} and dihydropteroate synthase type-1 and 11 gene (sul 1 & 11) {16 (8%)}. The results present an implicated environmental pollution problem and a potential concern to public health, therefore there is the need for control of such infectious bacteria and en-vironmental pollution monitoring. Hence, it is recommended various approaches crucial to monitoring of emerg-ing trends in drug resistance at the local and international levels. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Modelling drainage performance in an Indian catchment
SO JOURNAL OF THE CHARTERED INSTITUTION OF WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL
   MANAGEMENT
AB Surface-water flooding occurs frequently in low-income urban settlements of developing countries, with impacts on public health and the local economy. In many locations, drainage systems are neither appropriate nor sustainable. A computer model of a small surface-water drainage catchment has been developed within a slum improvement programme in Indore, India. The model was calibrated and verified against flow-survey data, and was used to study the effects on performance of maintenance (as reflected in solids build-up in pipes) and site grading. The results confirm the critical importance of maintenance in drainage performance and the need for construction engineers to consider drainage carefully before changing site-grading plans. The results also suggest some general trends in drainage performance during floods.

TI Least-Cost Path Analysis to Identify Retrofit Surface-Water Conveyance
   Solutions
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
AB Little guidance is available on how to identify optimally managed surface flood routes that can be engineered into the existing built environment. This paper addresses that gap. A least-cost path analysis was used to develop a tool based on topography and land use that automates and reduces the subjectivity in the search for viable surface-water conveyance solutions. The method is aimed at planning authorities who may use the tool to develop long-term strategic planning initiatives that identify key areas within the catchment where there is the opportunity to implement and manage flood flow routes. The least-cost path methodology was applied to identify the optimum retrofit-managed surface-water flood routes in Keighley, West Yorkshire, U.K. Three potential solutions were selected, and all three solutions reduced the number of flooded properties and enabled the surface-water catchments to retain greater proportions of the excess surface water within the catchment at non risk locations. The methodology provides the opportunity to identify the effect of each solution and hence to optimally manage the potential flood risk at an estimated cost. The least-cost path analysis to identify retrofit solutions has exciting potential for studies that need to build capacity and cope with climate change. However, the methodology has limitations in that it is highly dependent on the cost function that represents topography and land use. Costs associated with selected flood routes are extremely difficult to quantify, but such limitations will be overcome as additional cost and benefit data are made available from the implementation of a wider number of flood mitigation and rehabilitation measures. The least-cost path analysis offers a simple optioneering method that does not involve hydraulic analysis. Once a number of options have been identified, hydraulic analysis would be the next step in finding a viable solution.

TI Natural Products for Surface Water Coagulation: an Alternative
   Sustainable Solution for Rural Areas
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB This research aims at process optimization using response surface methodology (RSM) for coagulation of surface water by coagulants extracted from natural product. Apricot seeds extract (ASE), peach seeds extract (PSE) and mango seeds extract (MSE) were evaluated. The optimum operating conditions for ASE and PSE at initial turbidity of 27.5 NTU were pH 7 and coagulant dose of 45 mg/l. However, the optimum operating conditions for MSE at initial turbidity of 27.5 NTU were pH 5.5 and MSE dose of 45 mg/l. Under the optimum conditions, residual turbidity without filtration was 9.13, 10.3, 5.81 NTU for ASE, PSE and MSE, respectively. MSE could be used as secondary coagulant with the alum. At low turbidity surface water treatment, ratios of 20/80, 40/60 and 60/40 MSE/alum achieved residual turbidity of less than 1 NTU which comply with the Egyptian Standards. However, at medium turbidity surface water, ratio of 20/80 MSE/alum achieved residual turbidity of less than 1 NTU.

SP Int Space Sci Inst
AB Up to now, high-resolution mapping of surface water extent from satellites has only been available for a few regions, over limited time periods. The extension of the temporal and spatial coverage was difficult, due to the limitation of the remote sensing technique [e.g., the interaction of the radiation with vegetation or cloud for visible observations or the temporal sampling with the synthetic aperture radar (SAR)]. The advantages and the limitations of the various satellite techniques are reviewed. The need to have a global and consistent estimate of the water surfaces over long time periods triggered the development of a multi-satellite methodology to obtain consistent surface water all over the globe, regardless of the environments. The Global Inundation Extent from Multi-satellites (GIEMS) combines the complementary strengths of satellite observations from the visible to the microwave, to produce a low-resolution monthly dataset (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) of surface water extent and dynamics. Downscaling algorithms are now developed and applied to GIEMS, using high-spatial-resolution information from visible, near-infrared, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images, or from digital elevation models. Preliminary products are available down to 500-m spatial resolution. This work bridges the gaps and prepares for the future NASA/CNES Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission to be launched in 2020. SWOT will delineate surface water extent estimates and their water storage with an unprecedented spatial resolution and accuracy, thanks to a SAR in an interferometry mode. When available, the SWOT data will be adopted to downscale GIEMS, to produce a long time series of water surfaces at global scale, consistent with the SWOT observations.

TI Profiling physicochemical and planktonic features from
   discretely/continuously sampled surface water
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB There is an increasing need for assessing aquatic ecosystems that are globally endangered. Since aquatic ecosystems are complex, integrated consideration of multiple factors utilizing omics technologies can help us better understand aquatic ecosystems. An integrated strategy linking three analytical (machine learning, factor mapping, and forecast-error-variance decomposition) approaches for extracting the features of surface water from datasets comprising ions, metabolites, and microorganisms is proposed herein. The three developed approaches can be employed for diverse datasets of sample sizes and experimentally analyzed factors. The three approaches are applied to explore the features of bay water surrounding Odaiba, Tokyo, Japan, as a case study. Firstly, the machine learning approach separated 681 surface water samples within Japan into three clusters, categorizing Odaiba water into seawater with relatively low inorganic ions, including Mg, Ba, and B. Secondly, the factor mapping approach illustrated Odaiba water samples from the summer as rich in multiple amino acids and some other metabolites and poor in inorganic ions relative to other seasons based on their seasonal dynamics. Finally, forecast-error-variance decomposition using vector autoregressive models indicated that a type of microalgae (Raphidophyceae) grows in close correlation with alanine, succinic acid, and valine on filters and with isobutyric acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid in filtrate, Ba, and average wind speed. Our integrated strategy can be used to examine many biological, chemical, and environmental physical factors to analyze surface water. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Safe drinking water source identification is one of the vital components for designing and establishing an urban water supply system. Nowadays, water consumption in a country is one of the determining factors related to its development activities. Rapid growth of population and increased urbanization activities particularly in developing countries offer great challenges to the water utility managers and service providers. In this context, a major challenge is to ensure adequate supply of water with acceptable quality to every city dwellers with minimum cost. However, it is quite difficult to achieve this target, if there is a shortage in water availability from the existing sources imposed by water quantity and quality issues. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment task should be undertaken prior to designing and establishing a long-term water supply options in an urban area of a developing country like Bangladesh.
   In Bangladesh, municipal water supply scheme mainly depends on the conventional water sources such as surface water from the rivers and groundwater from the underlying aquifer. Although the groundwater quality is satisfactory for drinking purpose and available abundantly in the shallow aquifer, quality limitations of surface water impose economic constraints with additional treatment cost for system operation. Nevertheless, water availability in both sources may vary from place to place, and must be quantified before any planning and development of water supply scheme. Hence, this study attempts to identify appropriate conventional water sources by mathematical modelling as an assessment case study before establishing a sustainable urban water supply scheme at Rangunia municipality in Bangladesh, where there is no water supply system at present.
   Water demand in the Rangunia municipality is estimated up to the design year of 2040 based on the available population census data. Based on the regional model assessment results, suitability of surface water and groundwater sources against the existing and projected water demand has been evaluated. The Eastern Hill Region Model (EHRM) developed and maintained by the Institute of Water Modelling (IWM), Bangladesh is used for surface water source assessment. The flow simulation in the EHRM has been carried out by using MIKE-11 software. For developing groundwater model, the hydrogeological setting and aquifer demarcation in the municipality area is accomplished by analyzing the individual hydrostratigraphic sections produced from the borehole lithology. The groundwater model domain covers a larger area (4574 sq. km.) to avoid the boundary influence in model computation, which includes the study municipality (13.34 sq. km.). Therefore, the developed groundwater model of the study area spreads over 22 upazillas (sub-districts) of Chittagong, Rangamati and Khagrachhari districts in the eastern part of Bangladesh. Groundwater simulation is carried out in an integrated MIKE-11 and MIKE-SHE software platform.
   The simulation results along with measured water quality parameters indicate that none of the surface water and groundwater source is suitable for long-term water supply option in Rangunia municipality even though adequate quantity of water is available from both sources. Surface water source is highly associated with water quality issues based on Bangladesh drinking water standard, whereas groundwater level shows a decline trend on long-term exploitation. Therefore, the present study concludes that upon having a suitable treatment of surface water, existing surface water and/or groundwater sources can be used as safe drinking water sources for developing sustainable water supply scheme in Rangunia municipality of Bangladesh.

TI Climate mitigation and intensified forest management in Norway: To what
   extent are surface waters safeguarded?
SO AMBIO
AB While the role of forestry in mitigating climate change is increasingly subject to political commitment, other areas, such as water protection, may be at risk. In this study, we ask whether surface waters are sufficiently safeguarded in relation to the 2015 launch of a series of measures to intensify forest management for mitigation of climate change in Norway. First, we assess how impacts on water are accounted for in existing regulations for sustainable forestry. Secondly, we provide an overview of the impacts of forestry on water quality relevant to three support schemes: afforestation on new areas, increased stocking density in existing forests, and forest fertilisation. Lastly, we assess the uncertainties that exist with regard to surface waters in the implementation of these measures. We find that the safeguards in place are adequate to protect water resources at the point of initiation, but there is a large degree of uncertainty as to the long-term effect of these mitigation measures.

TI Hydrochemical characteristics and water quality of the Musnica River
   catchment, Bosnia and Herzegovina
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
AB The spatial position of the Musnica River catchment in the Dinaric Karst results in specific conditions of the drainage, distribution and chemical characteristics of the surface water and groundwater. This catchment is mountainous, located between 930 and 1985 m above sea level. The chemical characteristics of the waters are strongly dependent on the local lithological composition and the precipitation regime. The dominant cations are Ca2+ and Mg2+, and anions HCO3- and SO42-. The surface water is characterized by low and medium mineralization, with resultant soft, medium-hard and very-hard total hardness levels. The groundwater is more mineralized than the surface water. Gacko Town and its associated thermal power plant, Gacko 1, which are located in the southern part of the Musnica River catchment, have no modern facilities for sewage and wastewater transport or treatment. In order to prevent further water quality deterioration and to enable its sustainable use, it is recommended to ensure adequate protection measures in the catchment area.

TI Assessment of heavy metals in surface water, sediment and
   macrozoobenthos in inland rivers: a case study of the Heihe River,
   Northwest China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Long-term retention and accumulation of heavy metals in surface water and sediment pose a great threat to the sustainable development of aquatic ecosystems and human health. In this research, macrozoobenthos, and surface water and sediment heavy metal (Mn, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Cd, and As) samples were collected from 23 sites in the upper and middle reaches of the Heihe River in the summers of 2019-2020. The interrelationships between heavy metals and macrozoobenthos were analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA), and the contamination level and potential ecological risk of the heavy metals in surface water and sediments were assessed by comprehensive pollution index (WQI), single potential ecological risk index (E-r(i)), and sediment quality guideline-quotient (SQG-Q), respectively. The results showed that the level of heavy metal pollution in the surface water of the Heihe River was extremely low, but the contents of Mn and Pb exceeded the third class of surface water environmental quality standards (GB 3838-2002). The spatial distribution of heavy metals in surface sediments were significantly different, and the average concentration of 8 heavy metals exceeded the background values of Gansu Province. Meanwhile, the pollution level of heavy metals in surface sediments was high pollution, and the ecological risk level was moderate risk. Combining E-r(i) and SQG-Q evaluations showed that Cd, Ni, and Cr were the main ecological risk factors. In addition, the distribution coefficients of Cr and Cd were low, indicating that Cr and Cd were easily released from the surface sediments, causing secondary pollution. In terms of the source of the heavy metals, Cu, As, Zn, Cr, and Ni mainly came from industrial and agricultural wastewaters, Pb was from the mining industry and natural sources, and Mn and Cd mainly came from tailings and their landfill leachate. Basommatophora and Araneae can be used as potential indicator organisms for heavy metal pollution in surface water, and Basommatophora, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, and Araneae can be used as indicator species for heavy metal pollution in surface sediments. The study showed that macroinvertebrate community characteristics had a sensitive response to heavy metals in the surface waters and sediments of the Heihe River, which can be used to evaluate the pollution status of heavy metals in inland rivers.

SO INLAND WATER BIOLOGY
AB The specific/volumetric activity of radionuclides has been determined at global background levels in surface waters, bottom sediments, and hydrobionts at the site of the planned hydrotechnical facilities of the Baltic nuclear power plant (NPP). The presence of Sr-90 and Cs-l37 in the water medium due to global processes of the formation of radioactivity in the natural environment and the content of H-3 have been studied. It is established that the background values of the specific/volumetric activity of radionuclides are significantly lower than the admissible values according to NRB-99/2009, being at the level of the previous years (2009-2014). The results of these studies will serve as a basis for precision instrumental estimates of the effect of the Baltic NPP operation on the environment and will also be used to establish the background values of environmental parameters in the nuclear power site.

TI Illicit drugs, a novel group of environmental contaminants
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB It is now well established that residues from therapeutic drugs consumed by humans can end up, through the sewage system, in the surface water of populated areas. Given that the global production of major illicit drugs is comparable to that of widely used pharmaceuticals, we tested for the presence of drugs of abuse (cocaine, opioids, amphetamines and cannabis derivatives), some related opioid pharmaceuticals (codeine and methadone) and or their metabolites in Italian and British surface waters. Having identified residues of all major drugs abuse in raw and treated urban wastewater, we now measured their levels in several rivers and lakes by a selective multi-residue assay based on liquid chromatography-tandern mass spectrometry.
   Recoveries in surface water were generally higher than 80%, with overall variability of the method lower than 10%. LODs were generally lower than 0.2 ng/L, and LOQs were lower than 0.6 ng/L, with few exceptions. Many of the tested substances were found in both rivers and lakes, at concentrations ranging from high pg/L to high ng/L, with loads in rivers in the range of tenths to hundreds of grams per day. our data indicate that residues of drugs of abuse have become widespread surface water contaminants in populated areas. Since most of these residues still have potent pharmacological activities, their presence in the aquatic environment may have potential implications for human health and wildlife.

TI Effects of Water Source and Technology on Energy Use and Environmental
   Impacts of Rice Production in Northern Iran
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB To assess the sustainability of rice production systems, it is essential to quantify its impact on the environment and energy flow. To analyze the energy flow and greenhouse gas emissions, a total of 200 paddy fields were selected based on the water source utilized for irrigation (river as the surface water source and well as the underground water source), transplanting methods (traditional and mechanical) and grain yield (low- and high-yielding rice cultivars) based on a factorial experimental design (2 x 2 x 2 = 8 conditions). Data were collected in 2020 from 200 rice growers in northern Iran, using a face-to-face questionnaire survey. Results showed that the highest total energy use efficiency (EUE) (5.26 GJ ha(-1)) was observed under the surface water source + traditional + low-yielding rice system. Although the total EUE in surface water source was higher than that in groundwater source (4.98 vs. 2.90). Water consumption by high-yielding rice cultivars was higher, as compared to the low-yielding ones. Electricity (35.2%) and nitrogen fertilizer (31.5%) inputs were the highest energy input for the groundwater and surface water sources, respectively. Average shares of the renewable and non-renewable energies used in agroecosystems were 25.70% and 74.30% respectively, while the shares of the direct and indirect energies were 60.36% and 39.64%, respectively. The calculated global warming potential value in the paddy fields of northern Iran ranged from 878 to 2,666 kg eqCO(2) ha(-1). Amongst the studied conditions, the surface water source + traditional + high-yielding rice system had the highest carbon efficiency and carbon sustainability index level. Overall, surface water source conditions were found to be a more environmentally-friendly approach in northern Iran. These results, thus, demonstrated that there is a huge potential for improving energy efficiency in the studied conditions, especially for high-yielding rice cultivars irrigated by surface water sources. These findings could help decision-makers to better understand the linkage between various conditions, which is a prerequisite to any planning effort for future management strategies at national and international levels.

TI Integrated Modeling Framework to Evaluate Conjunctive Use Options in a
   Canal Irrigated Area
SO JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING
AB In canal irrigated areas, where interactions between surface water and groundwater are high, the conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater can play a significant role in improving water availability in time and space, thereby promoting more equitable distribution of water while maintaining long-term availability of groundwater resources. Achieving a harmonious balance between the use of surface water and groundwater requires careful consideration of the associated benefits, impacts, and trade-offs. In this study, a simple, integrated framework was developed and implemented to characterize and quantify interactions between surface water and groundwater in a canal irrigated area; this framework was used to evaluate the impacts of alternative levels of conjunctive use under varying climate and cropping conditions. Applying the model to a case study area of the Srisailam Right Branch Canal project in Andhra Pradesh, India, indicated that regulating canal supplies to optimum levels can prompt sustainable groundwater use and save up to 48% of allocated canal water; these water savings could be reallocated elsewhere within the irrigated area to promote equity.

TI A global hydrological simulation to specify the sources of water used by
   humans
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB Humans abstract water from various sources to sustain their livelihood and society. Some global hydrological models (GHMs) include explicit schemes of human water abstraction, but the representation and performance of these schemes remain limited. We substantially enhanced the water abstraction schemes of the H08 GHM. This enabled us to estimate water abstraction from six major water sources, namely, river flow regulated by global reservoirs (i.e., reservoirs regulating the flow of the world's major rivers), aqueduct water transfer, local reservoirs, seawater desalination, renewable groundwater, and nonrenewable groundwater. In its standard setup, the model covers the whole globe at a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees, and the calculation interval is 1 day. All the interactions were simulated in a single computer program, and all water fluxes and storage were strictly traceable at any place and time during the simulation period. A global hydrological simulation was conducted to validate the performance of the model for the period of 1979-2013 (land use was fixed for the year 2000). The simulated water fluxes for water abstraction were validated against those reported in earlier publications and showed a reasonable agreement at the global and country level. The simulated monthly river discharge and terrestrial water storage (TWS) for six of the world's most significantly human-affected river basins were compared with gauge observations and the data derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. It is found that the simulation including the newly added schemes outperformed the simulation without human activities. The simulated results indicated that, in 2000, of the 3628 +/- 75 km(3) yr(-1) global freshwater requirement, 2839 +/- 50 km(3) yr(-1) was taken from surface water and 789 +/- 30 km(3) yr(-1) from groundwater. Streamflow, aqueduct water transfer, local reservoirs, and seawater desalination accounted for 1786 +/- 23, 199 +/- 10, 106 +/- 5, and 1.8 +/- 0 km(3) yr(-1) of the surface water, respectively. The remaining 747 +/- 45 km(3) yr(-1) freshwater requirement was unmet, or surface water was not available when and where it was needed in our simulation. Renewable and nonrenewable groundwater accounted for 607 +/- 11 and 182 +/- 26 km(3) yr(-1) of the groundwater total, respectively. Each source differed in its renewability, economic costs for development, and environmental consequences of usage. The model is useful for performing global water resource assessments by considering the aspects of sustainability, economy, and environment.

TI Residues of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in aquatic environment and
   risk assessment along Shaying River, China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH
AB Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are pesticides with global scale ubiquity, persistence and bioaccumulation, which leave long-term residuals in the water body. OCPs' high toxicity poses significant threats to human health and aquatic biodiversity, making assessment of OCPs' impact on aquatic ecology and human health urgently necessary. In this research, the presence of 16 OCPs in surface water and groundwater along Shaying River, China, as well as OCPs concentration correlations, was investigated at 24 selected sampling sites. At the same time, the ecological risk and human carcinogenic risk were also analyzed by risk quotient method and USEPA's Risk Assessment Guidance, respectively. Results showed that the total concentration of OCPs ranged from 21.0 to 61.4 ng L-1 in groundwater, and 12.3-77.5 ng L-1 in surface water. Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCHs) and heptachlor were the prominent contaminants in groundwater, which indicated their use in the recent past and confirmed their persistence. The alpha-HCH/-HCH ratios in groundwater confirmed that gamma-HCH (lindane) was used as main substitute of technical HCH in the study area. The correlation analysis illustrated that delta-HCH and gamma-HCH played a dominant role in HCHs residue. Heptachlor and alpha-HCH, as well as endosulfan and heptachlor epoxide, had a strongly significant positive correlation, suggesting an associated usage of the two pair OCPs. An extremely high ecological risk for aquatic organism was observed for gamma-HCH, heptachlor and dieldrin, while the carcinogenic risks posed by the selected OCPs in surface water and groundwater were all acceptable.

TI Agricultural insecticides threaten surface waters at the global scale
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Compared with nutrient levels and habitat degradation, the importance of agricultural pesticides in surface water may have been underestimated due to a lack of comprehensive quantitative analysis. Increasing pesticide contamination results in decreasing regional aquatic biodiversity, i.e., macroinvertebrate family richness is reduced by similar to 30% at pesticide concentrations equaling the legally accepted regulatory threshold levels (RTLs). This study provides a comprehensive metaanalysis of 838 peer-reviewed studies (>2,500 sites in 73 countries) that evaluates, for the first time to our knowledge on a global scale, the exposure of surface waters to particularly toxic agricultural insecticides. We tested whether measured insecticide concentrations (MICs; i.e., quantified insecticide concentrations) exceed their RTLs and how risks depend on insecticide development over time and stringency of environmental regulation. Our analysis reveals that MICs occur rarely (i.e., an estimated 97.4% of analyses conducted found no MICs) and there is a complete lack of scientific monitoring data for similar to 90% of global cropland. Most importantly, of the 11,300 MICs, 52.4% (5,915 cases; 68.5% of the sites) exceeded the RTL for either surface water (RTLSW) or sediments. Thus, the biological integrity of global water resources is at a substantial risk. RTLSW exceedances depend on the catchment size, sampling regime, and sampling date; are significantly higher for newer-generation insecticides (i.e., pyrethroids); and are high even in countries with stringent environmental regulations. These results suggest the need for worldwide improvements to current pesticide regulations and agricultural pesticide application practices and for intensified research efforts on the presence and effects of pesticides under real-world conditions.

TI Surface water monitoring in small water bodies: potential and limits of
   multi-sensor Landsat time series
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB Hydrometric monitoring of small water bodies (110 ha) remains rare, due to their limited size and large numbers, preventing accurate assessments of their agricultural potential or their cumulative influence in watershed hydrology. Landsat imagery has shown its potential to support mapping of small water bodies, but the influence of their limited surface areas, vegetation growth, and rapid flood dynamics on long-term surface water monitoring remains unquantified. A semi-automated method is developed here to assess and optimize the potential of multi-sensor Landsat time series to monitor surface water extent and mean water availability in these small water bodies. Extensive hydrometric field data (1999-2014) for seven small reservoirs within the Merguellil catchment in central Tunisia and SPOT imagery are used to calibrate the method and explore its limits. The Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI) is shown out of six commonly used water detection indices to provide high overall accuracy and threshold stability during high and low floods, leading to a mean surface area error below 15 %. Applied to 546 Landsat 5, 7, and 8 images over 19992014, the method reproduces surface water extent variations across small lakes with high skill (R-2 = 0.9) and a mean root mean square error (RMSE) of 9300m(2). Comparison with published global water datasets reveals a mean RMSE of 21 800m(2) (+ 134 %) on the same lakes and highlights the value of a tailored MNDWI approach to improve hydrological monitoring in small lakes and reduce omission errors of flooded vegetation. The rise in relative errors due to the larger proportion and influence of mixed pixels restricts surface water monitoring below 3 ha with Landsat (Normalised RMSE = 27 %). Interferences from clouds and scan line corrector failure on ETM+ after 2003 also decrease the number of operational images by 51 %, reducing performance on lakes with rapid flood declines. Combining Landsat observations with 10m pansharpened Sentinel-2 imagery further reduces RMSE to 5200m(2), displaying the increased opportunities for surface water monitoring in small water bodies after 2015.

TI Groundwater-surface water interactions: New methods and models to
   improve understanding of processes and dynamics
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
AB Interest in groundwater (GW)-surface water (SW) interactions has grown steadily over the last two decades. New regulations such as the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) now call for a sustainable management of coupled ground- and surface water resources and linked ecosystems. Embracing this mandate requires new interdisciplinary research on GW-SW systems that addresses the linkages between hydrology, biogeochemistry and ecology at nested scales and specifically accounts for small-scale spatial and temporal patterns of GW-SW exchange. Methods to assess these patterns such as the use of natural tracers (e.g. heat) and integrated surface-subsurface numerical models have been refined and enhanced significantly in recent years and have improved our understanding of processes and dynamics. Numerical models are increasingly used to explore hypotheses and to develop new conceptual models of GW-SW interactions. New technologies like distributed temperature sensing (DTS) allow an assessment of process dynamics at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. These developments are reflected in the contributions to this Special Issue on GW-SW interactions. However, challenges remain in transferring process understanding across scales.

TI Combining groundwater quality analysis and a numerical flow simulation
   for spatially establishing utilization strategies for groundwater and
   surface water in the Pingtung Plain
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB Overexploitation of groundwater is a common problem in the Pingtung Plain area of Taiwan, resulting in substantial drawdown of groundwater levels as well as the occurrence of severe seawater intrusion and land subsidence. Measures need to be taken to preserve these valuable groundwater resources. This study seeks to spatially determine the most suitable locations for the use of surface water on this plain instead of extracting groundwater for drinking, irrigation, and aquaculture purposes based on information obtained by combining groundwater quality analysis and a numerical flow simulation assuming the planning of manmade lakes and reservoirs to the increase of water supply. The multivariate indicator kriging method is first used to estimate occurrence probabilities, and to rank townships as suitable or unsuitable for groundwater utilization according to water quality standards for drinking, irrigation, and aquaculture. A numerical model of groundwater flow (MODFLOW) is adopted to quantify the recovery of groundwater levels in townships after model calibration when groundwater for drinking and agricultural demands has been replaced by surface water. Finally, townships with poor groundwater quality and significant increases in groundwater levels in the Pingtung Plain are prioritized for the groundwater conservation planning based on the combined assessment of groundwater quality and quantity. The results of this study indicate that the integration of groundwater quality analysis and the numerical flow simulation is capable of establishing sound strategies for joint groundwater and surface water use. Six southeastern townships are found to be suitable locations for replacing groundwater with surface water from manmade lakes or reservoirs to meet drinking, irrigation, and aquaculture demands.

TI Assessing Climate Change Impact on Water Balance Components Using
   Integrated Groundwater-Surface Water Models (Case Study: Shazand Plain,
   Iran)
SO WATER
AB Assessing the status of water resources is essential for long-term planning related to water and many other needs of a country. According to climate reports, climate change is on the rise in all parts of the world; however, this phenomenon will have more consequences in arid and semi-arid regions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of climate change on groundwater, surface water, and their exchanges in Shazand plain in Iran, which has experienced a significant decline in streamflow and groundwater level in recent years. To address this issue, we propose the use of the integrated hydrological model MODFLOW-OWHM to simulate groundwater level, surface water routing, and their interactions; a climate model, NorESM, under scenario SSP2, for climate data prediction; and, finally, the HEC-HMS model to predict future river discharge. The results predict that, under future climate conditions, the river discharges at the hydrometric stations of the region may decrease by 58%, 63%, 75%, and 81%. The average groundwater level in 2060 may decrease significantly by 15.1 m compared to 2010. The results of this study reveal the likely destructive effects of climate change on water resources in this region and highlight the need for sustainable management methods to mitigate these future effects.

TI Impacts of Climate Variability and Drought on Surface Water Resources in
   Sub-Saharan Africa Using Remote Sensing: A Review
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Climate variability and recurrent droughts have caused remarkable strain on water resources in most regions across the globe, with the arid and semi-arid areas being the hardest hit. The impacts have been notable on surface water resources, which are already under threat from massive abstractions due to increased demand, as well as poor conservation and unsustainable land management practices. Drought and climate variability, as well as their associated impacts on water resources, have gained increased attention in recent decades as nations seek to enhance mitigation and adaptation mechanisms. Although the use of satellite technologies has, of late, gained prominence in generating timely and spatially explicit information on drought and climate variability impacts across different regions, they are somewhat hampered by difficulties in detecting drought evolution due to its complex nature, varying scales, the magnitude of its occurrence, and inherent data gaps. Currently, a number of studies have been conducted to monitor and assess the impacts of climate variability and droughts on water resources in sub-Saharan Africa using different remotely sensed and in-situ datasets. This study therefore provides a detailed overview of the progress made in tracking droughts using remote sensing, including its relevance in monitoring climate variability and hydrological drought impacts on surface water resources in sub-Saharan Africa. The paper further discusses traditional and remote sensing methods of monitoring climate variability, hydrological drought, and water resources, tracking their application and key challenges, with a particular emphasis on sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, characteristics and limitations of various remote sensors, as well as drought and surface water indices, namely, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Normalized Difference Vegetation (NDVI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and Water Requirement Satisfaction Index (WRSI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI+5), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI+5), Automated Water Extraction Index (shadow) (AWEI(sh)), and Automated Water Extraction Index (non-shadow) (AWEI(nsh)), and their relevance in climate variability and drought monitoring are discussed. Additionally, key scientific research strides and knowledge gaps for further investigations are highlighted. While progress has been made in advancing the application of remote sensing in water resources, this review indicates the need for further studies on assessing drought and climate variability impacts on water resources, especially in the context of climate change and increased water demand. The results from this study suggests that Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite data are likely to be best suited to monitor climate variability, hydrological drought, and surface water bodies, due to their availability at relatively low cost, impressive spectral, spatial, and temporal characteristics. The most effective drought and water indices are SPI, PDSI, NDVI, VCI, NDWI, MNDWI, MNDWI+5, AWEI(sh), and AWEI(nsh). Overall, the findings of this study emphasize the increasing role and potential of remote sensing in generating spatially explicit information on drought and climate variability impacts on surface water resources.
   However, there is a need for future studies to consider spatial data integration techniques, radar data, precipitation, cloud computing, and machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to improve on understanding climate and drought impacts on water resources across various scales.

TI Elevated levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in
   freshwater benthic macroinvertebrates from the Hudson River Watershed
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are contaminants of global concern due to their persistence and associated negative health effects. Considerable attention has been given to monitoring PFAS in the aquatic environment, however, few investigations have done so using freshwater benthic macroinvertebrates (BMIs). As these bottom-dwelling animals are known to bioconcentrate exogenous pollutants to a high degree, studying their PFAS levels may provide a more integrated view of PFAS contamination in the aquatic environment. In this study, BMIs, sediment, and surface water were collected from two streams in the Hudson River Watershed (one historically-impacted by PFAS) and analyzed for 44 PFAS using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was used to confirm the identities of quantitated analytes. Across all matrices, 17 analytes were detected with PFOA dominating in surface water and PFOS in sediment/BMIs. PFOS bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were approximately one order of magnitude higher than those of PFOA and ranged from 857 to 5151 L kg-1 across different BMI taxa. While PFAS concentrations in surface water and sediment were not excessively high, elevated levels were still measured in most BMI taxa. This observation suggests that the extent of PFAS contamination in a local system may be severely underestimated if only surface water and sediment are used for monitoring. Moreover, these findings have relevance for human exposure assessment considering BMIs are the primary food source of many fish.

TI Water availability and land subsidence in the Central Valley,
   California, USA
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB The Central Valley in California (USA) covers about 52,000 km(2) and is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world. This agriculture relies heavily on surface-water diversions and groundwater pumpage to meet irrigation water demand. Because the valley is semi-arid and surface-water availability varies substantially, agriculture relies heavily on local groundwater. In the southern two thirds of the valley, the San Joaquin Valley, historic and recent groundwater pumpage has caused significant and extensive drawdowns, aquifer-system compaction and subsidence. During recent drought periods (2007-2009 and 2012-present), groundwater pumping has increased owing to a combination of decreased surface-water availability and land-use changes. Declining groundwater levels, approaching or surpassing historical low levels, have caused accelerated and renewed compaction and subsidence that likely is mostly permanent. The subsidence has caused operational, maintenance, and construction-design problems for water-delivery and flood-control canals in the San Joaquin Valley. Planning for the effects of continued subsidence in the area is important for water agencies. As land use, managed aquifer recharge, and surface-water availability continue to vary, long-term groundwater-level and subsidence monitoring and modelling are critical to understanding the dynamics of historical and continued groundwater use resulting in additional water-level and groundwater storage declines, and associated subsidence. Modeling tools such as the Central Valley Hydrologic Model, can be used in the evaluation of management strategies to mitigate adverse impacts due to subsidence while also optimizing water availability. This knowledge will be critical for successful implementation of recent legislation aimed toward sustainable groundwater use.

TI Challenges of governing groundwater in US western states
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Over the last several decades, water users in the western United States have increasingly turned to groundwater resources to support economic development, but few institutional arrangements were in place to govern groundwater use. Over time, numerous groundwater problems have emerged. Two closely related explanations for this are explored. Surface water sources were the first to be developed, and institutional arrangements to allocate surface water were the first to be devised. These arrangements are not particularly well suited for governing groundwater. Furthermore, the physical differences between rivers and aquifers lead to differences in the development of each type of water, and in production and organization costs. Groundwater development involves low upfront production costs, which individual water users can cover. Once groundwater users have individually invested in productive activities problems emerge, such as declining water tables. Thus, unlike surface water users, groundwater users are faced with devising institutional arrangements to coordinate their water uses after they have invested in and developed productive economic activities. Most western states regulate pumping, although groundwater users, in general, resist pumping limits. The discussion concludes with proposals for modifying the prior appropriation doctrine to better accommodate the active management of groundwater basins for long-term sustainability.

TI Impact of flooding on microbiological contamination of domestic water
   sources: a longitudinal study in northern Ghana
SO APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
AB Flooding is the most frequent natural hazard globally, but evidence of its impact on domestic water point contamination remains limited. This study aimed to assess dam-related flooding's impact on microbiological contamination of rural water points and to evaluate agreement of satellite-derived flood maps with ground-based observations of water point flooding. Fieldwork took place in two Ghanaian districts frequently flooded following dam overspill. Fifty-seven water points were tested for bacterial parameters during and immediately after flooding. Forty water points were resampled in the dry season, with the remainder having run dry. Ground-based observations of flooding were compared with three satellite-derived flood maps. Boreholes were less contaminated than wells or surface waters (geometric mean E. coli = 20.2, 175.6, and 590.7 cfu/100 ml, respectively). Among groundwater points, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated significantly greater median E. coli and thermotolerant coliform contamination during flooding (p = 0.025 and p < 0.001, respectively), but Shigella, salmonella, and intestinal enterococci counts were not significantly different between seasons. In contrast, among surface water points, E. coli, Shigella, and Salmonella counts were significantly greater in dry season samples (p < 0.005 for all parameters), possibly reflecting a "concentration" effect. Satellite-derived flood maps had no or low agreement with ground-based observations of water point flooding. Although groundwater quality deteriorated during and after flooding, surface waters were the most microbiologically contaminated in both seasons. The greatest public health risk thus occurred where households switched to surface water collection during or following flood season. Flood risk should be assessed before borehole installation and existing flood-prone boreholes remediated to mitigate population exposure to contaminated water.

TI Hydrochemical characteristics and irrigation suitability of surface
   water in the Syr Darya River, Kazakhstan
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB The surface water hydrochemistry of the Syr Darya River in Kazakhstan was investigated at 39 locations to analyze regional hydrochemical characteristics and evaluate the irrigation suitability of the studied regions. The cations in the surface water are mainly Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, while the anions are mainly SO42-. The main hydrochemical type is Ca-Mg-SO4-Cl. From the perspective of natural factors, the hydrochemical characteristics in the study area are derived from the dual effects of rock weathering and evaporation-concentration; however, the influence of anthropogenic factors include industrial and agricultural production near the river and the inflow of urban domestic sewage on the hydrochemical characteristic is also present. The irrigation suitability evaluation of the surface water based on SAR, Na% and KI showed that the majority of the water is suitable for irrigation, and from the TDS content analysis, 71.43% of the samples are in a critical state, indicating that the influence of TDS concentration on irrigation suitability cannot be ignored. The results have practical significance for maintaining the sustainable use of water resources in the Syr Darya River.

TI Spatial distribution of microplastics in sediments and surface waters of
   the southern North Sea
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Microplastic pollution within the marine environment is of pressing concern globally. Accordingly, spatial monitoring of microplastic concentrations, composition and size distribution may help to identify sources and entry pathways, and hence allow initiating focused mitigation. Spatial distribution patterns of microplastics were investigated in two compartments of the southern North Sea by collecting sub-littoral sediment and surface water samples from 24 stations. Large microplastics (500-5000 mu m) were detected visually and identified using attenuated total reflection (ATR) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The remaining sample was digested enzymatically, concentrated onto filters and analyzed for small microplastics (11-500 mu m) using Focal Plane Array (FPA) FTIR imaging. Microplastics were detected in all samples with concentrations ranging between 2.8 and 1188.8 particles kg(-1) for sediments and 0.1-245.4 particles m(-3) for surface waters. On average 98% of microplastics were <100 mu m in sediments and 86% in surface waters. The most prevalent polymer types in both compartments were polypropylene, acrylates/polyurethane/varnish, and polyamide. However, polymer composition differed significantly between sediment and surface water samples as well as between the Frisian Islands and the English Channel sites. These results show that microplastics are not evenly distributed, in neither location nor size, which is illuminating regarding the development of monitoring protocols. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Detection of antimicrobial-resistance diarrheagenic Escherichia coli
   strains in surface water used to irrigate food products in the northwest
   of Mexico
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY
AB Water contamination by pathogenic bacteria is a global public health problem. Contamination of surface water utilized to irrigate food products, or for human consumption, causes outbreaks of foodborne and waterborne disease. Of these, those caused by diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) strains present substantial morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate the microbiological quality of surface water and the presence of DEC strains in different water bodies. A total of 472 water samples were collected from irrigation canal, dam, river, and dike water bodies from January through December 2015 in Sinaloa, a State located in Northwestern Mexico. Our studies demonstrated that 47.0% (222/472) of samples contained thermotolerant coliforms above permissive levels whereas E. coli strains were isolated from 43.6% (206/472). Among these E. coli isolates, DEC strains were identified in 14% (29/206) of samples including in irrigation canal (26/29) and river water (3/29) collected from the northern (83%) and central area (17%). Isolated DEC strains were classified as enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) 34.4% (10/29), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) 31.0% (9/29), diffuse adherent E. coli (DAEC) 27.5% (8/29), and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) 6.8% (2/29). Moreover, 90% of isolated DEC strains exhibited resistance to at least one commonly prescribed antibiotic in Mexico whereas 17% were multi-drug resistant. In conclusion, the presence of DEC strains in surface water represents a potential source for human infection, and thus routine monitoring of DEC in surface water and other indirect affected. areas should be considered at northwestern Mexico.

TI Grouping of Water Supply-and-Demand Structure in the Yellow River Basin
   of China: Focusing on Balance between Groundwater and Surface-water
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The research purpose of this study was to uncover the grouping of the water supply-and-demand structure in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) of China, focusing on the balance between groundwater and surface-water. Comparing the structure of water usage and the structure of groundwater usage estimated by previous studies in each region, 35 municipalities were selected and they were classified into 12 catchments in focusing on the geographical location and the similarity of the shape of the structure of water supply-and-demand. In the upper reaches, surface-water is mainly used and the share of agricultural usage is small, therefore, seasonal variability of groundwater usage is small. On the other hand, in the middle and the lower reaches, the share of groundwater is large and the share of agricultural usage is large, therefore, seasonal variability of groundwater usage is large. Especially, these characteristics are obvious in the Loess Plateau. In addition, surface-water is mainly used again in the lowermost reaches. The results qualitatively identify the spatial pattern of the classification of water supply-and-demand structure and investigate the geographical heterogeneity within each catchment. Performing a GIS (Geographic Information System) -based estimation is meaningful for grasping the geospatial pattern of water supply-and-demand structure and for providing an area-by-area report of the situation of the water resource usage. It is hoped that this study serves as an academic reference for optimizing the water resource management and for providing some policy recommendations on resource's sustainability by using a GIS-based approach.

TI Surface Water Extraction and Dynamic Analysis of Baiyangdian Lake Based
   on the Google Earth Engine Platform Using Sentinel-1 for Reporting SDG
   6.6.1 Indicators
SO WATER
AB Surface water is an essential element that supports natural ecosystem health and human life, and its losses or gains are closely related to national or local sustainable development. Monitoring the spatial-temporal changes in surface water can directly support the reporting of progress towards the sustainable development goals (SDGs) outlined by the government, especially for measuring SDG 6.6.1 indicators. In our study, we focused on Baiyangdian Lake, an important lake in North China, and explored its spatiotemporal extent changes from 2014 to 2020. Using long-term Sentinel-1 SAR images and the OTSU algorithm, our study developed an automatic water extraction framework to monitor surface water changes in Baiyangdian Lake at a 10 m resolution from 2014 to 2020 on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform. The results showed that (1) the water extraction accuracy in our study was considered good, showing high consistency with the existing dataset. In addition, it was found that the classification accuracy in spring, summer, and fall was better than that in winter. (2) From 2014 to 2020, the surface water area of Baiyangdian Lake exhibited a slowly rising trend, with an average water area of 97.03 km(2). In terms of seasonal variation, the seasonal water area changed significantly. The water areas in spring and winter were larger than those in summer and fall. (3) Spatially, most of the water was distributed in the eastern part of Baiyangdian Lake, which accounted for roughly 57% of the total water area. The permanent water area, temporary water area, and non-water area covered 49.69 km(2), 97.77 km(2), and 171.55 km(2), respectively. Our study monitored changes in the spatial extent of the surface water of Baiyangdian Lake, provides useful information for the sustainable development of the Xiong'an New Area and directly reports the status of SDG 6.6.1 indicators over time.

TI Land suitability and surface water resources potential for irrigation in
   Becho Plain, upper Awash basin, Ethiopia
SO IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
AB In this study, an assessment of the land and surface water resources potential of the Becho Plain was conducted. Land suitability for irrigated agriculture was evaluated by considering the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) criteria. The land suitability parameters such as soil properties, slope, land use and land cover were used to identify the suitable irrigable land. The analytical hierarchy process was employed to obtain parameter weights, and later the weighted overlay analysis in the geographic information system was employed to obtain the overall suitability of land resources for irrigation. The surface water availability and amount were evaluated by using the calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The water requirement of dominant crops was estimated following the FAO procedure and compared with the available water. Nearly 70% of the land area is identified as suitable for surface irrigation, while the remaining 30% of the land area is restricted for irrigation development. The water supply and demand analysis revealed that there is sufficient water available in the Becho Plain for irrigation development. The physically possible irrigation area and diversion sites were also identified. The Becho Plain has ample land and water resources for irrigation development. However, future developments shall also consider downstream water use to implement sustainable irrigation development.

TI American archives and climate change: Risks and adaptation
SO CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT
AB Climate change directly affects the future security of cultural resources. Cultural heritage and in particular, archives, are increasingly at risk of degradation due to climate change threats and triggers. This study evaluated present and future consequences of water-related climate change impacts using a mapping methodology to assess exposure of American archives to incompatible weather extremes. Susceptibility to climate change threats like sea level rise, storm surge, surface water flooding, and humidity, all influenced by a combination of temperature rise and increased precipitation, at a worst-case scenario were assessed for 1232 archival repositories. Results indicate that approximately 98.8% of archives are likely to be affected by at least one climate risk factor, though on average, most archives are at low risk of exposure (90%) when risk factors are combined. Future storm surge plus sea level rise was likely to impact 17.7% of archival repositories with 22.1% affected by only storm surge and 4.3% affected by only sea level rise (1.8m scenario). Fewer archives were likely to be susceptible to surface water flooding (2.4%). More than 90% of archives were estimated to have a temperature change greater than +/- 1 degrees C, with 7.5% of sites likely to change by +/- 10 degrees C, and 69.5% of archives were likely to receive at least 152mm more rainfall by 2100 over current annual averages. In terms of sustainability, developing appropriate socio-economic planning schemes that integrate cumulative exposure of archives to future climate patterns is critically important for safeguarding society and its heritage. The outcomes from the risk assessment in this study aid in the decision-making process by promoting strategic adaptation protocols and providing administrators a way to prioritize archival management goals based on the expected severity of future climate change impacts.

TI The fate of phthalate acid esters in wastewater treatment plants and
   their impact on receiving waters
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Phthalates (PAEs) are gaining attention and being researched as an endocrine disruptor as global plastic use surge. There is an urgent need to explore the key factors affecting the removal of PAEs from wastewater and the impact of wastewater effluent on receiving water. Here we investigated the levels and distribution patterns of 16 typical PAEs in surface water and five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) along the Dongyang River from Yiwu, China, col-lecting 42 surface water and 31 wastewater samples. We found that influent PAEs concentration and treatment process were the key factors affecting the degradation efficiency of PAEs in primary and secondary treatment, respectively. In primary treatment, long-chain PAEs were more easily removed (and sometimes less likely to accumulate) than short -chain PAEs, regardless of the influent PAEs concentration (a key factor in primary treatment), while in secondary treat-ment, short-chain PAEs were easily removed regardless of the treatment process (a factor in secondary treatment). This was not the case for long-chain PAEs, which were only more readily removed in the A/A/O process. In addition, by comparing the significant differences between wastewater and surface water, we found that the total PAEs in the treated effluent were significantly lower than in surface water upstream and in built-up urban areas, indicating that wastewater discharges in the study area did not increase PAEs in the receiving water. Finally, river in the city center and artificial treatment facilities in the study area were identified as requiring priority attention. The results of this study can serve as a model for controlling PAEs in other similar developing cities in China and provide valuable infor-mation on the fate of endocrine disruptor from wastewater treatment in China and their impact on surface water.

TI Sustainable Proposal for Regulating Organophosphate Pesticides in
   Wastewater Treatment Plants in South Korea
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Organophosphate pesticides (OPs) are highly toxic; their presence in surface waters is a matter of great concern. To the best of our knowledge, OPs in wastewater from agrochemical manufacturing facilities (AMFs) and influents and effluents from agrochemical wastewater treatment plants (AWWTPs) have not been previously investigated. Therefore, we investigated the presence of 8 OPs (5 of which are regulated under the Water Environment Conservation Act (WECA)) in 15 AMFs and 13 AWWTPs detected through surface water monitoring and proposed measures for effectively regulating these OPs in AWWTPs. Five OPs (chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dichlorvos, EPN, and fenitrothion) were detected in the AMF and AWWTP influents; three (methyldemeton, parathion, and phenthoate) were not. Of the five detected OPs, chlorpyrifos, dichlorvos, and fenitrothion are not currently regulated via effluent limitations for WWTPs under WECA; thus, additional regulations are required. The most effective process configuration for the removal of these OPs was biological treatment through activated sludge processes, followed by activated carbon adsorption. In the system, 100% OP removal from the AWWTP influents was observed. This treatment technology can be implemented in AWWTPs to minimize the presence of OPs in surface waters, thereby protecting human health and aquatic life.

TI Ecologically sustainable surface water withdrawal for cropland
   irrigation through incorporation of climate variability
SO JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
AB In several regions of the world, interannual variations in precipitation and stream flows are related to ocean-atmosphere oscillation known as El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Pacific Ocean. El Nino events, which occur after every 2 to 10 years, are caused by high sea surface temperature and a low Southern Oscillation Index. La Nina events arc caused by low sea surface temperature and a high Southern Oscillation Index. Because ENSO events can be accurately predicted in advance using a physical model of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system, it is now feasible to incorporate ENSO predictions in real-time water resources management. The objective of this study was to establish the relationship between ENSO and precipitation, ENSO and temperature, and ENSO and stream flows, and then use these relationships to develop a surface water withdrawal prescription for cropland irrigation in a southwest Alabama, United Stakes, watershed. An additional objective was to determine the percentage of the watershed that could be irrigated through. ENSO-based, ecologically sustainable surface water withdrawal. The study was conducted in the Big Creek watershed located in Mobile County, Alabama, using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for simulating stream flows and developing surface water withdrawal prescriptions. Strong relationships were found between ENSO and precipitation, ENSO and temperature, and ENSO and stream flow in this watershed. From November to July, El Nino episodes generated higher precipitation than La Nina episodes. On the contrary in September and October, La Nina episodes resulted in higher precipitation than El Nino episodes. Results suggest that El Nino episodes produced higher stream flows during November to August than La Nina episodes. Water withdrawal followed the same trend as the stream flow did. On an average, it was found that around 20% of the watershed can be irrigated through ENSO-based, ecologically sustainable surface water withdrawal.

TI Inland surface waters in protected areas globally: Current coverage and
   30-year trends
SO PLOS ONE
AB Inland waters are unique ecosystems offering services and habitat resources upon which many species depend. Despite the importance of, and threats to, inland water, global assessments of protected area (PA) coverage and trends have focused on land habitats or have assessed land and inland waters together. We here provide the first assessment of the level of protection of inland open surface waters and their trends (1984-2015) within PAs for all countries, using a globally consistent, high-resolution (30 m) and validated dataset on permanent and seasonal surface waters based on Landsat images. Globally, 15% of inland surface waters are covered by PAs with mapped boundaries. Estimated inland water protection increases to 16.4% if PAs with reported area but delineated only as points are included as circular buffers. These coverage estimates slightly exceed the comparable figure for land but fall below the 17% goal of the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi Target 11 for 2020. Protection levels are very uneven across countries, half of which do not yet meet the 17% target. The lowest coverage of surface water by PAs (<5%) was found in Africa and in parts of Asia. There was a global trend of permanent water losses and seasonal water gains within PAs, concomitant with an increase of both water types outside PAs. In 38% of countries, PAs lost over 5% of permanent water. Global protection targets for inland waters may well be met by 2020, but much stronger efforts are required to ensure their effective conservation, which will depend not only on sound PA governance and management but also on the sustainable use of water resources outside PAs. Given the pressures on water in a rapidly changing world, integrated management planning of water resources involving multiple sectors and entire basins is therefore necessary.

TI Spectral unmixing based random forest classifier for detecting surface
   water changes in multitemporal pansharpened Landsat image
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB The gradual depletion of surface water in major lakes and their impact in the sustainable development of local water resources has been a great challenge. Monitoring surface water and detecting changes in the lake are the main objectives of this study. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) and Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) of 2010, 2000 and 2018 Lake Urmia images acquired from US Geological Survey were used for detecting the changes. Surface water changes are usually identified by extracting the water features from individual time series multispectral images. In this study, a novel change detection framework has been proposed involving pixel level fusion and classification. The spatial frequency based undecimated wavelet transform fusion (UDWT - SF) effectively extracted the spectral information from MS image and spatial infor-mation from PAN image of the same scene captured at different time periods. The endmembers of the fused images were selected using pixel purity index endmember extraction algorithm and the abundance estimation by the application of fully constrained least square spectral unmixing algorithm. An efficient sub-pixel classification process is designed by employing the spectral signatures, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the abundance estimation generated from the pansharpened image in a random forest classifier. Experimental results indicate that the proposed classifier attained 99.9945% user's accuracy for water area and 99.9675% producer's accuracy for changed area. Similarly, the producer's accuracy of water and changed area are 99.9866% and 99.9868% respectively. The kappa coefficient and the overall accuracy of the proposed sub-pixel random forest classification on multitemporal multispectral image is 0.97 and 99.89% respectively. The lake surface area is computed and it is found that an area of 1369 Sq km has been decreased from the year 2000 to 2010 and 310 Sq km decreased from 2010 to 2018 as per the assessment based on the proposed random forest classifier. Spectral unmixing based random forest classifier (RF-SP) on fused image yields better results in terms of accuracy compared to other classifiers and it is more appropriate for detecting the multitemporal surface water changes.

TI Identification of Potential Surface Water Resources for Inland
   Aquaculture from Sentinel-2 Images of the Rwenzori Region of Uganda
SO WATER
AB Aquaculture has the potential to sustainably meet the growing demand for animal protein. The availability of water is essential for aquaculture development, but there is no knowledge about the potential inland water resources of the Rwenzori region of Uganda. Though remote sensing is popularly utilized during studies involving various aspects of surface water, it has never been employed in mapping inland water bodies of Uganda. In this study, we assessed the efficiency of seven remote-sensing derived water index methods to map the available surface water resources in the Rwenzori region using moderate resolution Sentinel 2A/B imagery. From the four targeted sites, the Automated Water Extraction Index for urban areas (AWEInsh) and shadow removal (AWEIsh) were the best at identifying inland water bodies in the region. Both AWEIsh and AWEInsh consistently had the highest overall accuracy (OA) and kappa (OA > 90%, kappa > 0.8 in sites 1 and 2; OA > 84.9%, kappa > 0.61 in sites 3 and 4), as well as the lowest omission errors in all sites. AWEI was able to suppress classification noise from shadows and other non-water dark surfaces. However, none of the seven water indices used during this study was able to efficiently extract narrow water bodies such as streams. This was due to a combination of factors like the presence of terrain shadows, a dense vegetation cover, and the image resolution. Nonetheless, AWEI can efficiently identify other surface water resources such as crater lakes and rivers/streams that are potentially suitable for aquaculture from moderate resolution Sentinel 2A/B imagery.

TI Surface Water and Energy Budgets for the Mississippi River Basin in
   Three NCEP Reanalyses
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
AB Surface water and energy budgets from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-U.S. Department of Energy (NCEP-DOE) Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP-II) Global Reanalysis 2 (GR2), the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), and the NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) are compared here with each other and with available observations over the Mississippi River basin. The comparisons in seasonal cycle, interannual variation, and annual mean over a 31-yr period show that there are a number of noticeable differences and similarities in the large-scale basin averages. Warm season precipitation and runoff in the GR2 are too large compared to the observations, and seasonal surface water variation is small. By contrast, the precipitation in both NARR and CFSR is more reasonable and in better agreement with the observation, although the corresponding seasonal runoff is very small. The main causes of the differences in both surface parameterization and approach used in assimilating the observed precipitation datasets and snow analyses are then discussed. Despite the discrepancies in seasonal water budget components, seasonal energy budget terms in the three reanalyses are close to each other and to available observations. The interannual variations in both water and energy budgets are comparable. This study shows that the CFSR achieves a large improvement over the GR2, indicating that the CFSR dataset can be used in climate variability studies. Nonetheless, improved land surface parameterization schemes and data assimilation techniques are needed to depict the surface water and energy climates better, in particular, the variation in seasonal runoff.

TI Non-renewable groundwater use and groundwater depletion: a review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Population growth, economic development, and dietary changes have drastically increased the demand for food and water. The resulting expansion of irrigated agriculture into semi-arid areas with limited precipitation and surface water has greatly increased the dependence of irrigated crops on groundwater withdrawal. Also, the increasing number of people living in mega-cities without access to clean surface water or piped drinking water has drastically increased urban groundwater use. The result of these trends has been the steady increase of the use of non-renewable groundwater resources and associated high rates of aquifer depletion around the globe. We present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in research on non-renewable groundwater use and groundwater depletion. We start with a section defining the concepts of non-renewable groundwater, fossil groundwater and groundwater depletion and place these concepts in a hydrogeological perspective. We pay particular attention to the interaction between groundwater withdrawal, recharge and surface water which is critical to understanding sustainable groundwater withdrawal. We provide an overview of methods that have been used to estimate groundwater depletion, followed by an extensive review of global and regional depletion estimates, the adverse impacts of groundwater depletion and the hydroeconomics of groundwater use. We end this review with an outlook for future research based on main research gaps and challenges identified. This review shows that both the estimates of current depletion rates and the future availability of non-renewable groundwater are highly uncertain and that considerable data and research challenges need to be overcome if we hope to reduce this uncertainty in the near future.

TI Occurrence and risk evaluation of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in
   wastewater and surface water of Lahore, Pakistan
SO ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH
AB The current study highlights the occurrence, spatial distribution, and risk assessment of 16 endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) including their transformation products (TPs) in the wastewater and surface water of Lahore, Pakistan, using solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The parent EDCs include bisphenol A (BPA), triclosan (TCS), triclocarban (TCC), estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), ethinylestradiol (EE2), 4-n-octylphenol (4n-OP), and 4-n-nonylphenol (4n-NP). The TPs include two TPs each of BPA, TCC, and estrogens along with a TP of TCS. Most EDCs showed 100% detection frequency in the wastewater with highest median concentration of 1310 ng/L for E3. In the surface water, the highest median concentration was, however, observed for BPA (54.6 ng/L). Spatial variations in terms of sum of concentration due to all EDCs and their TPs were observed at different sampling points which suggest contamination due to industrial waste from nearby industrial estate. Risk evaluation in terms of risk quotient (RQ) and estradiol equivalent factor (EEQ) showed that most of EDCs and their TPs could pose high risk and estrogenicity to the surrounding environment. From the results of the current study, it is observed that the environment of Pakistan is deteriorating and is potential risk for endocrine disruption. It is, therefore, recommended to take stringent measures to make it sustainable for current as well as for future generations.

TI Assessment of spatial-temporal patterns of surface and ground water
   qualities and factors influencing management strategy of groundwater
   system in an urban river corridor of Nepal
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB This study examined the spatial-temporal variations and factors influencing the management of groundwater along a section of the Bagmati river corridor in the Kathmandu valley (Nepal). The results showed that rural areas were less polluted than urban areas. In urban areas, the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations ranged from 8.41 to 29.74 mg/L, 6.7 to 128.96 mg/L and 0.06 to 1.5 mg/L, respectively. In rural areas, the BOD, TN and TP concentrations ranged from 0.78 to 18.25 mg/L, 4.8 to 11.56 mg/L and 0.07 to 0.65 mg/L, respectively. The level of organics was higher in the pre-monsoon season, while the level of nutrients was higher in post-monsoon season. A comparison of the groundwater and surface water in the upstream rural areas revealed that the TP concentration was higher in the groundwater than in the surface water, which was attributed to the sorption of phosphorus on iron, aluminum or calcium compounds contained in the surface water, which depends upon the temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen. In urban areas, a few wells were found at groundwater levels lower than the corresponding surface water levels and were subjected to a high risk of pollution. Overall, these findings reinforce the notion that the management of surface and ground waters in an integrated approach is essential for attaining sustainable development of groundwater systems.

TI Groundwater and surface-water interactions and impacts of human
   activities in the Hailiutu catchment, northwest China
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB The interactions between groundwater and surface water have been significantly affected by human activities in the semi-arid Hailiutu catchment, northwest China. Several methods were used to investigate the spatial and temporal interactions between groundwater and surface water. Isotopic and chemical analyses of water samples determined that groundwater discharges to the Hailiutu River, and mass balance equations were employed to estimate groundwater seepage rates along the river using chemical profiles. The hydrograph separation method was used to estimate temporal variations of groundwater discharges to the river. A numerical groundwater model was constructed to simulate groundwater discharges along the river and to analyze effects of water use in the catchment. The simulated seepage rates along the river compare reasonably well with the seepage estimates derived from a chemical profile in 2012. The impacts of human activities (river-water diversion and groundwater abstraction) on the river discharge were analyzed by calculating the differences between the simulated natural groundwater discharge and the measured river discharge. Water use associated with the Hailiutu River increased from 1986 to 1991, reached its highest level from 1992 to 2000, and decreased from 2001 onwards. The reduction of river discharge might have negative impacts on the riparian ecosystem and the water availability for downstream users. The interactions between groundwater and surface water as well as the consequences of human activities should be taken into account when implementing sustainable water resources management in the Hailiutu catchment.

TI Forecasting surface water temperature in lakes: A comparison of
   approaches
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB Accurate water temperature forecasting in lake systems is important for environmental impact assessment and fisheries management, among others. In this study, two models are developed and applied for water temperature forecasting in lake systems: (1) the multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) model; and (2) the wavelet transform and MLPNN integrated model (WT_MLPNN). The models are applied to forecast daily lake surface water temperature (LSWT) of eight lowland Polish lakes. Long-term daily LSWT from eight lakes and daily air temperatures from seven meteorological stations are used for daily LSWT forecasting. The results from the two models are compared with those obtained from two other widely used models: the physically-statistically based hybrid air2water model and a non-linear regression model (S-curve). The modelling results show that the air2water model performs the best, followed by the WT_MLPNN, MLPNN, and the non-linear regression model. Overall, the air2water, WT_MLPNN, and MLPNN models reproduce well the seasonal and inter-annual variations of the LSWT dynamics in the eight lakes. The non-linear regression model, although providing the lowest accuracy, can still provide good preliminary estimates of the LSWT for the eight lakes. The outcomes of the present research can provide references for forecasting lake surface water temperature and sustainable management of lake ecosystems.

TI A critical review of synthetic chemicals in surface waters of the US,
   the EU and China
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB There is a wide concern that emerging organic pollutants (EOPs) in surface water could adversely affect human health and wildlife. However, the geographic distribution, exposure pattern and ecological risk of emerging organic pollutants are poorly understood at a global scale. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the exposure level of EOPs in China, the US and the EU based on the published literature. The hazard level of three categories of EOPs, namely pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides and industrial chemicals was further evaluated by adopting a novel Aquatic HazPi index that jointly accounts for the persistence, bioaccumulation, toxicity and bioactivity. Furthermore, a correlation analysis of land use with the surface water exposure status regarding the synthetic chemicals was conducted. According to the published data reported between 2010 and 2016, the concentration of pesticides in the US was higher than in the EU and China. The concentration of PPCPs in the EU was generally lower than in both the US and China, while the concentration of industrial chemicals in China was higher than in the EU and the US. Among the chemicals whose median concentration in surface water was > 10 ng/L, the antiretroviral Efavirenz, the pesticide Fipronil, and octocrylene, an industrial chemical and cosmetic ingredient, were found with the highest aquatic HazPi value. Lastly, the spatial distribution and concentration of hazardous EOPs was shown to depend on local landscape and land usages. Our study provides the first broad overview on the geographic distribution, exposure pattern of hazardous EOPs in the three major economic entities: China, the US and the EU.

AB The performance of concrete structures is largely affected by the susceptibility of the concrete to the penetration of water. Ingress of moisture or other aggressive liquids through the interconnected pores reaches to the inner part of the concrete structures and causes deterioration. A study has thus been carried out to find the surface water absorption characteristics of high strength self-consolidating concrete (HSSCC). A total of sixteen HSSCC mixes were prepared to investigate the effect of marble waste powder (MWP), Fly Ash (FA), and micro-silica (MS) as a partial replacement of cement on surface water absorption characteristics. Surface water absorption was evaluated using the sorptivity test after 28 days curing period. The initial and secondary rate of absorption was calculated for each HSSCC mix. Sorptivity test results indicated that the incorporation of supplementary cementitious materials in HSSCC resulted in increased resistance against surface water absorption. Incorporation of 5% MS in HSSCC resulted in reduced water absorption through the exposed surface. All the ternary mixes (made with Cement + MS + FA and Cement + MS + MWP) and quaternary mixes (made with Cement + MS + FA + WMP) showed higher resistance against surface water absorption than the reference mixture. However, the highest surface water absorption resistance was found for a ternary mix made with 5% and 35% substitution of cement with MS and FA respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Gainers and losers of surface and terrestrial water resources in China
   during 1989-2016
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Data and knowledge of the spatial-temporal dynamics of surface water area (SWA) and terrestrial water storage (TWS) in China are critical for sustainable management of water resources but remain very limited. Here we report annual maps of surface water bodies in China during 1989-2016 at 30m spatial resolution. We find that SWA decreases in water-poor northern China but increases in water-rich southern China during 1989-2016. Our results also reveal the spatial-temporal divergence and consistency between TWS and SWA during 2002-2016. In North China, extensive and continued losses of TWS, together with small to moderate changes of SWA, indicate long-term water stress in the region. Approximately 569 million people live in those areas with deceasing SWA or TWS trends in 2015. Our data set and the findings from this study could be used to support the government and the public to address increasing challenges of water resources and security in China. The authors of this study compile data on spatial and temporal dynamics of surface water bodies across China, covering a time span from 1989 - 2016. The study describes hot-spot areas with strongly decreasing trends in surface water area and terrestrial water storage in North China and discusses implications of water resources and security in China.

TI Groundwater surface water interactions and the role of phreatophytes in
   identifying recharge zones
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB Groundwater and surface water interactions within riparian corridors impact the distribution of phreatophytes that tap into groundwater stores. The changes in canopy area of phreatophytes over time is related to changes in depth to groundwater, distance from a stream or river, and hydrologic soil group. Remote sensing was used to determine the location of trees with pre-development and post-development aerial photography over the Ogallala Aquifer in the central plains of the United States. It was found that once the depth to groundwater becomes greater than about 3 m, tree populations decrease as depth to water increases. This subsequently limited the extent of phreatophytes to within 700 m of the river. It was also found that phreatophytes have a higher likelihood of growing on hydrologic soil groups with higher saturated hydraulic conductivity. Phreatophytes exist along portions of the Arkansas River corridor where significant decreases in groundwater occurred as long as alluvium exists to create perched conditions where trees survive dry periods. Significant decreases (more that 50%) in canopy cover exists along river segments where groundwater declined by more than 10 m, indicating areas with good hydraulic connectivity between surface water and groundwater. Thus, interpretation of changes in phreatophyte distribution using historical and recent aerial photography is important in delineating zones of enhanced recharge where aquifers might be effectively recharged through diversion of surface water runoff.

TI A first assessment of microplastics and other anthropogenic particles in
   Hudson Bay and the surrounding eastern Canadian Arctic waters of Nunavut
SO FACETS
AB Microplastics are a globally ubiquitous contaminant, invading the most remote regions, including the Arctic. To date, our understanding of the distribution and sources of microplastics in the Arctic is limited but growing. This study aims to advance our understanding of microplastics in the Arctic. Surface water, zooplankton, sediment, and snow samples were collected from Hudson Bay to north Baffin Bay onboard the CCGS Amundsen from July to August 2017. Samples were examined for microplastics, which were chemically identified via Raman spectroscopy for surface water and zooplankton and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for sediment. We found that 90% of surface water and zooplankton samples, and 85% of sediment samples, contained microplastics or other anthropogenic particles. Mean anthropogenic particle concentrations, which includes microplastics, were 0.22 +/- 0.23 (per litre) for surface water, 3.51 +/- 4.00 (per gram) for zooplankton, and 1.94 +/- 4.12 (per gram) for sediment. These concentrations were not related to the human populations upstream, suggesting that microplastic contamination in the Arctic is from long-range transport. Overall, this study highlights the presence of microplastics across the eastern Canadian Arctic, in multiple media, and offers evidence of long-range transport via ocean and atmospheric currents. Further research is needed to better understand sources, distribution, and effects to Arctic ecosystems.

AB Water pollution is a worldwide problem that needs to be solved urgently and has a significant impact on the efficiency of sustainable cities. The evaluation of water pollution is a Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problem and using a MCDM model can help control water pollution and protect human health. However, different evaluation methods may obtain different results. How to effectively coordinate them to obtain a consensus result is the main aim of this work. The purpose of this article is to develop an ensemble learning evaluation method based on the concept of water quality to help policy-makers better evaluate surface water quality. A valid application is conducted to illustrate the use of the model for the surface water quality evaluation problem, thus demonstrating the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model.

AB Groundwater is a valuable natural resource providing a primary source of water for agriculture, domestic and industrial purposes. To Jinan, it is more significant because of the famous springs. But springs have drained off for several years because of groundwater over-extraction. Surface water and groundwater is an integrated system and the environment is a whole. Integrated management is essential. So this paper gives an integrated act for groundwater protection. Considering the surface water, groundwater, water quantity and quality, ecology, socio-economics of Jinan, especially the connection between surface water and groundwater, this integrated act consists of increasing groundwater recharge, restricting groundwater exploitation, jointly regulating and integrated management. These projects aims to balance groundwater exploitation and recharge, guarantee the springs against draining off, achieve a good ecological status. The environment as a whole will be improved. Different water users will benefit and the economy will be prosperous. So this act will promote the sustainable development. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Surface Water under Growing Anthropogenic Loads: From Global
   Perspectives to Regional Implications
SO WATER
AB This paper reviews currently available evaluations of the effects of continuously increasing anthropogenic loads on water resources. The increase in the fluxes of elements and compounds into the environment, such as the emission of greenhouse gases and dispersion of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), acidifying gases, and toxic elements and compounds that adversely affect water quality, are considered. The significance of fresh waters as a life support factor for human populations is demonstrated. Examples illustrate how key anthropogenic-induced processes develop in land waters under the effect of anthropogenic loads, as exemplified by the Russian Kola regions. Climate warming and the increasing dispersion of elements are demonstrated to result in the eutrophication of surface waters, even in areas remote from anthropogenically impacted regions. Although the emissions of acidifying gases diminish, the waters are still acidified in acid-vulnerable areas, and the chemical compositions of the waters have been significantly modified over the past decades, indicating that the changes in the chemical composition of the waters are irreversible. A new feature of the waters is distinguished: the toxicity of the habitats for aquatic organisms. The novelty of the work was to highlight the bridge between anthropogenic loads on surface water on a planetary scale and their consequences in certain regions, which reflect changes in water quality. Arguments are presented for establishing a theoretical approach for evaluating critical loads.

TI Exploring global Cryptosporidium emissions to surface water
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium is a major cause of diarrhoea worldwide. This paper presents the first model-based inventory with 0.5 by 0.5 degree resolution of global Cryptosporidium emissions for the year 2000 from humans and animals to surface water. The model is based on nutrient distribution modelling, because the sources and transport of oocysts and nutrients to the surface water are comparable. Total emissions consist of point source emissions from wastewater and nonpoint source emissions by runoff of oocysts in manure from agricultural lands. Results indicate a global emission of 3 x 10(17) oocysts per year, with comparable contributions from point and nonpoint sources. Hot-spot areas for point sources are big cities in China, India and Latin America, while the area with the largest nonpoint source emissions is in China. Uncertainties in the model are large. Main areas for further study are (i) excretion rates of oocysts by humans and animals, (ii) emissions of humans not connected to sewage systems, and (iii) retention of oocysts to determine surface water pathogen concentrations rather than emissions. Our results are useful to health organisations to identify priority areas for further study and intervention. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) for surface water management
   plan, a case study of Kansachara sub-watershed, West Bengal, India
SO WATER SUPPLY
AB The increasing demands on fresh water resources by our burgeoning population and diminishing quality of existing water resources because of pollution and the additional requirements of serving our spiraling industrial and agricultural growth have led to a situation where the consumption of water is rapidly increasing and the supply of fresh water remains more or less constant. In the context of quality, potable water is always meager for the present and future. The study is an innovative attempt towards the development of the watershed on the earth science platform. Thereafter the balancing of water resources for domestic and agricultural uses is also tried. The focus is mainly on surface water for present use and groundwater for future. This management plan especially includes socially and economically backward demographic conditions. The present study is an integrated approach for a micro-watershed development plan of the Kansachara sub-watershed.

TI An Optical and SAR Based Fusion Approach for Mapping Surface Water
   Dynamics over Mainland China
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Earth Observation (EO) data is a critical information source for mapping and monitoring water resources over large inaccessible regions where hydrological in-situ networks are sparse. In this paper, we present a simple yet robust method for fusing optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for mapping surface water dynamics over mainland China. This method uses a multivariate logistic regression model to estimate monthly surface water extent over a four-year period (2017 to 2020) from the combined usages of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery. Multi-seasonal high-resolution images from the Chinese Gaofen satellites are used as a reference for an independent validation showing a high degree of agreement (overall accuracy 94%) across a diversity of climatic and physiographic regions demonstrating potential scalability beyond China. Through inter-comparison with similar global scale products, this paper further shows how this new mapping technique provides improved spatio-temporal characterization of inland water bodies, and for better capturing smaller water bodies (< 0.81 ha in size). The relevance of the results is discussed, and we find this new enhanced monitoring approach has the potential to advance the use of Earth observation for water resource management, planning and reporting.

TI Analysis of Seasonal Water Characteristics and Water Quality Responses
   to the Land Use/Land Cover Pattern: A Case Study in Tianjin, China
SO WATER
AB As the second largest city in northern China, Tianjin has a unique geographical and social status. Following its rapid economic development, Tianjin is experiencing high levels of surface water pollution. The land use/land cover (LULC) pattern has a considerable impact on hydrological cycling and pollutant transmission, and thus on regional water quality. A full understanding of the water quality response to the LULC pattern is critical for water resource management and improvement of the natural environment in Tianjin. In this study, surface water monitoring station data and LULC data from 2021 to 2022 were used to investigate the surface water quality in Tianjin. A cluster analysis was conducted to compare water quality among monitoring stations, a factor analysis was conducted to identify potential pollution sources, and an entropy weight calculation was used to analyze the impact of the land use pattern on water quality. The mean total nitrogen (TN) concentration exceeded the class V water quality standard throughout the year, and the correlation coefficient of the relationship between dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH exceeded 0.5 throughout the year, with other water quality parameters showing seasonal changes. On the basis of their good water quality, the water quality monitoring stations near large water source areas were distinguished from those near areas with other LULC patterns via the cluster analysis. The factor analysis results indicated that the surface water in Tianjin suffered from nutrient and organic pollution, with high loadings of ammonia nitrogen (NH3N), TN, and total phosphorus (TP). Water pollution was more serious in areas near built-up land, especially in the central urban area. The entropy weight calculation results revealed that water, built-up land, and cultivated/built-up land had the greatest impact on NH3N, while cultivated land had the greatest impact on electrical conductivity (EC). This study discusses the seasonal changes of surface water and impact of land use/land cover pattern on water quality at a macro scale, and highlighted the need to improve surface water quality in Tianjin. The results provide guidance for the sustainable utilization and management of local water resources.

AB GSFLOW is a new U. S. Geological Survey model for simulating ground-water/surface-water interactions. GSFLOW couples PRMS (the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System) to MODFLOW (the Modular Ground-Water Model) with modules for simulating flow and storage in unsaturated-zones, lakes, and streams. GSFLOW simulates infiltration, runoff generation, and lateral flow in temporarily saturated material (i.e., interflow beneath storm-generated perched water tables) with physically based equations. Unsaturated-zone flow beneath the soil zone is based on a 1-d kinematic-wave approximation to the Richards' equation, implicitly coupled to MODFLOW. GSFLOW simulates spatial-and time-varying ground-water recharge on the basis of daily energy and mass balances among precipitation, solar radiation, heat, evapotranspiration, runoff, infiltration, and storage in the snowpack and soil zone, and percolation and storage through the unsaturated zone as well as changes to recharge caused by ground-water pumping and surface-water diversions. The water resources of multiple basins in the United States and Australia are being evaluated with GSFLOW. The model will be used to relate physical and hydrologic characteristics of the basins such as land use, geography, and climate to water resources issues such as sustainable yield and surface-water/ground-water interaction. Application of GSFLOW in three dissimilar basins will provide a robust means of testing the new model and could provide new insights when assessing water-resources across the world.

AB GeoEnviron is a database system designed for mapping of potential contaminated sites. This system was used for mapping of sites in two selected pilot areas in Slovakia in a Slovak-Danish pilot project. The pilot areas were chosen to meet criteria that ensure typical potential pollutant sources for Slovakia to be represented as well as different type of geology, hydrogeology and surface water concerns.
   Data were collected from various authorities, owners of the sites and site visits. Data on 385 sites are gathered in the GeoEnviron database including chemical plants, oil storage, waste deposits etc. Every site is described with address, potential pollution sources, ground water vulnerability, distance to houses and surface water, geographic co-ordinates, scanned maps etc.
   A preliminary risk assessment including a ranking of potential risk to land use, ground water and surface water is prepared in the two pilot areas. The ranking is prepared according to a slightly modified Danish method for prioritisation of polluted point sources. The ranking is based on the data within the GeoEnviron database as well as prepared maps related to surface water and ground water management and the most hazardous chemical from each site.
   The main objective of the project have been to provide a good overview of potential contaminated sites; a tool for prioritisation of clean up projects and sustainable development of land use as well as water resource management.

TI Estimation of nitrate load from septic systems to surface water bodies
   using an ArcGIS-based software
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
AB Nitrate, as a commonly identified groundwater and surface water pollutant, poses serious threats to human health and the environment. One important source of nitrate in the environment is due to wastewater treatment using Onsite Sewage Treatment and Disposal Systems (OSTDS) (a.k.a., septic systems). To facilitate water resources and environmental management, an ArcGIS-Based Nitrate Load Estimation Toolkit (ArcNLET) is developed to simulate nitrate transport and estimate nitrate load from septic systems and collocated fertilizer applications in groundwater to surface water bodies. It is a screening tool based on a simplified conceptual model of groundwater flow and nitrate transport. It is used in this study to estimate nitrate load from thousands of septic systems to surface water bodies in two neighborhoods located in Jacksonville, FL, USA, where nitrate due to septic systems is believed to be one of the reasons of nutrient enrichment and an isotope study indicates that denitrification is significant. A global sensitivity analysis is performed to identify critical parameters for model calibration, and the most critical parameter is the first-order decay coefficient used to simulate the denitrification process. Hydraulic conductivities at different soil zones have different levels of influence on simulated nitrate concentrations at different locations. By manually adjusting model parameters, simulated shapes of water table and nitrate concentration agree reasonably with average field observations, suggesting that ArcNLET is able to simulate spatial variability of field observations. Estimated nitrate loads exhibit spatial variability, which is useful to facilitate decisions on the conversion of OSTDS into sewers in certain areas for reducing nitrate load from septic systems to surface water bodies.

TI Determination of the Concentration and Isotope Ratio of Trace Lead in
   Lake Mashu by Solid-phase Extraction/ICP-MS
SO BUNSEKI KAGAKU
AB Lake Mashu is the only lake that serves as a baseline station of the United Nations Global Environment Monitoring System/Water (GEMS/Water) Programme. In this study, the concentration of trace lead in lake-water samples was determined by solid-phase extraction/concentration-ICP-MS to clarify the depth vertical profiles of lead. The finding that the lead concentration in the lake water above the thermocline shows a higher value than that in the lake water below the thermocline means that the input of lead into the surface water occurs during the thermocline-stratification period. The isotopic ratios (Pb-208/Pb-206 and Pb-207/Pb-206) were measured to estimate the origin of the lead. The obtained lead isotopic ratios in the surface water samples are similar to the reported values of the lead emitted in Japan rather than those at the Eurasia continent. The quantitative and isotopic analytical results in this study suggest a potential input of anthropogenically derived lead, presumably originating in Japan, into the surface water of Lake Mashu via the atmosphere since there is no inflowing river to the lake.

TI Global occurrence and aquatic hazards of antipsychotics in sewage
   influents, effluent discharges and surface waters
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Despite increasing reports of pharmaceuticals in surface waters, aquatic hazard information remains limited for many contaminants, particularly for sublethal, chronic responses plausibly linked to molecular initiation events that are largely conserved across vertebrates. Here, we critically examined available refereed information on the occurrence of 67 antipsychotics in wastewater effluent and surface waters. Because the majority of sewage remains untreated around the world, we also examined occurrence in sewage influents. When sufficient information was available, we developed probabilistic environmental exposure distributions (EEDs) for each compound in each matrix by geographic region. We then performed probabilistic environmental hazard assessments (PEHAs) using therapeutic hazard values (THVs) of each compound, due to limited sublethal aquatic toxicology information for this class of pharmaceuticals. From these PEHAs, we determined predicted exceedances of the respective THVs for each chemical among matrices and regions, noting that THV values of antipsychotic contaminants are typically lower than other classes of human pharmaceuticals. Diverse exceedances were observed, and these aquatic hazards varied by compound, matrix and geographic region. In wastewater effluent discharges and surface waters, sulpiride was the most detected antipsychotic; however, percent exceedances of the THV were minimal (0.6%) for this medication. In contrast, we observed elevated aquatic hazards for chlorpromazine (30.5%), aripiprazole (37.5%), and perphenazine (68.7%) in effluent discharges, and for chlorprothixene (35.4%) and flupentixol (98.8%) in surface waters. Elevated aquatic hazards for relatively understudied antipsychotics were identified, which highlight important data gaps for future environmental chemistry and toxicology research.

TI Perfluorinated compounds in surface waters of Shanghai, China: Source
   analysis and risk assessment
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB 17 perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) were systematically investigated in the surface water from principal watersheds of Shanghai, China. 10 PFCs were above the detection limit (0.08-0.28 ng/L) in 39 surface water samples. The perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorobutanesulfonate (PFBS) were the two dominant compounds with a median concentration 50.67 ng/L and 29.84 ng/L, respectively. Concentrations of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) were generally less than PFBS, which might result from the global phase-out of PFOS production and the use of PFBS as a substitute for PFOS-based products. There were three major polluted areas of PFOA along the Huangpu River. The PFOA concentration in groundwater samples collected from one of the three areas indicated that chemical industry might be the possible source. The perfluoroalkane sulfonates (PFSAs) level had a spatial trend that indicated northwest had higher concentrations than the southeast. The distribution of PFCs was not much affected by atmospheric deposition. Mass loading analysis in the surface water revealed that the Huangpu River exhibited relatively large mass loading of total PFCs of 1742.43 kg/year to Yangtze River Estuary. The predominant of the PFC species was PFOA with 652.65 kg/year. The current concentrations of PFOA and PFOS were at middle level comparing to other studies in China and worldwide. Risk assessment of 6 PFCs showed that there is no risk to the aquatic organisms in Shanghai. PFOS and PFBS had low risk to the avian. Furthermore, the adults living in Shanghai were at low risk to exposure to PFCs through water consumption.

TI Hydrochemical Characteristics and the Relationship between Surface and

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Water environment monitoring is an important way to optimize the allocation and sustainable utilization of regional water resources and is beneficial for ensuring the security of regional water resources. In order to explore hydrochemical distributions in a mountain-oasis ecosystem in Central Asia, surface water and groundwater samples from the Kaidu River basin were collected over four seasons. pH values, major ions, total dissolved solids (TDS) and stable isotopes were determined during the period from 2016 to 2017. The results showed: (1) that most water bodies in the study areas were mildly alkaline and that hydrochemical distributions showed significant seasonal and spatial variation; (2) that delta D and delta O-18 in surface water and groundwater showed enrichment in summer and autumn and poverty in spring and winter, with higher delta O-18 values appearing in the oasis area and lower delta O-18 values appearing in the mountain area; (3) that most of the water bodies in the study areas were of HCO3-Ca2+ type, with the hydrochemical types of groundwater presenting obvious spatial inconsistency relative to surface water; (4) that rock weathering was the main factor controlling hydrochemical composition in the study areas and that human activities had an influence on the groundwater environment in the oasis area; (5) and that surface water-groundwater interactions also displayed spatial inconsistency, especially in summer. The interaction between river water and groundwater was more obvious in the traditional oasis area, especially in spring and summer. The results will be important for regional water resource management and sustainable water utilization.

TI Modeling the extent of surface water floods in rural areas: Lessons
   learned from the application of various uncalibrated models
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
AB Surface water floods (SWFs) do not only increasingly threaten cities, but also affect rural areas. So far, little research has been dedicated to the prediction of SWFs in rural environments, although in practice the process is already being considered in deterministic flood hazard assessments. To test the validity of such assessments, we select four raster-based models with differing complexity and evaluate whether they reliably predict inundated areas by SWF in rural areas. The uncalibrated models are first applied to four artificial surfaces and second, to eight case studies covering manifold geographical and meteorological settings. For the case studies, the models' prediction skills are assessed based on inundated areas inferred from various sources. The models' performance is rather low for all case studies, which highlights the necessity for calibration and/or validation of such models. Moreover, the case studies provide more general conclusions concerning the modeling of SWFs in rural areas.

TI Improvement to quality of surface waters from rural communities:
   vegetable extracts as a sustainable and cheap alternative
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB The high degree of pollution and cost of water treatment in rural communities of developing countries have led to a constant search of alternative cheap, versatile and easy for surface water treatment. In this sense, the aim of this study was to determine the removal power of turbidity, color, chlorides and nitrites of the plant pitahaya (Hylocereus triangularis), guasimo (Guazuma ulmifolia) and cactus nopal (Opuntia ficus-indica) in surface waters. An extraction was performed, and the optimal dose of each extract using a jar test was selected. After extracts were mixed to increase their flocculent/coagulant power, pitahaya removed turbidity in 97%, color 91%, chlorides 82% and nitrites 92%. For the same parameters, guasimo showed a removal of 95%, 89%, 74% and 94%, respectively. The mixture of pitahaya and guasimo removed 100% of nitrites. The plants studied have potential use for the removal of turbidity, color, chlorides and nitrites in water for human consumption and industrial wastewater.

TI Impacts of population growth, urbanisation and sanitation changes on
   global human Cryptosporidium emissions to surface water
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
CT 7th International Water and Health Seminar
CY JUN 29-JUL 01, 2015
CL Cannes, FRANCE
AB Cryptosporidium is a pathogenic protozoan parasite and is a leading cause of diarrhoea worldwide. The concentration of Cryptosporidium in the surface water is a determinant for probability of exposure and the risk of disease. Surface water concentrations are expected to change with population growth, urbanisation and changes in sanitation. The objective of this paper is to assess the importance of future changes in population, urbanisation and sanitation on global human emissions of Cryptosporidium to surface water. The GloWPa-Crypto H1 (the Global Waterborne Pathogen model for Human Cryptosporidium emissions version 1) model is presented and run for 2010 and with scenarios for 2050. The new scenarios are based on the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) developed for the climate community. The scenarios comprise assumptions on sanitation changes in line with the storylines and population and urbanisation changes from the SSPs. In SSP1 population growth is limited, urbanisation large and sanitation and waste water treatment strongly improve. SSP1* is the same as SSP1, but waste water treatment does not improve. SSP3 sees large population growth, moderate urbanisation and sanitation and waste water treatment fractions that are the same as in 2010. Total global Cryptosporidium emissions to surface water for 2010 are estimated to be 1.6 x 10(17) oocysts per year, with hotspots in the most urbanised parts of the world. In 2050 emissions are expected to decrease by 24% or increase by 52% and 70% for SSP1, SSP3 and SSP1* respectively. The emissions increase in all scenarios for countries in the Middle East and Africa (MAF) region, while emissions in large parts in Europe decrease in scenarios SSP1 and SSP3. Improving sanitation by connecting the population to sewers, should be combined with waste water treatment, otherwise (SSP1*) emissions in 2050 are expected to be much larger than in a situation with strong population growth and slow development of safe water and improved sanitation (SSP3). The results show that population increase, urbanisation and changes in sanitation should be considered when water quality and resulting health risks are estimated by water managers or public health specialists.

TI Bank Filtration as Natural Filtration
SO DRINKING WATER TREATMENT: FOCUSING ON APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY AND
   SUSTAINABILITY
SE Strategies for Sustainability
AB When wells are placed close to a surface water source (such as a lake or a river) and pumped, a portion of the surface water is induced to flow to the well. As the water travels from the river to the well through the riverbed sediments and underlying aquifer material, suspended and dissolved contaminants of surface water are "naturally" filtered out using a combination of physical, chemical, and biological processes. If the surface water is a river, the system is called riverbank filtration (RBF). If a lake serves as source water, the system is a lakebank filtration. These natural filtration systems have been operating for more than 100 years in Europe and for over half a century in the United States, providing safe drinking water to communities. For the RBF systems to work effectively, there must be a hydraulic connection between the river and the alluvial aquifer where the wells are located. Unclogged river bottoms are ideal for RBF operations. RBF systems are known to remove turbidity, microbes, and chemicals present in surface water and the removal efficiency is a function of well location, pumping rate, source water quality, etc. A fraction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is also removed which helps in reducing the formation potential of disinfection by products during chlorination of the filtrate from RBF systems. RBF systems can be adapted to a given site using engineering judgment. Use of inflatable dams to raise water levels in rivers in low-flow periods can augment well yields. Similarly, diverting a part of the water from the river to an infiltration basin and strategically placing wells between the river and the infiltration basin can enhance yield. Over the years, several improvements to the design and construction of the RBF systems have taken place. Use of these methods at future sites can improve the efficiency of RBF. Besides siting issues, periodic maintenance and early-warning systems to monitor river water quality are needed for sustainable operation of RBF systems. RBF has one of the best potentials to be used as a natural filtration system in populated riparian communities in developing countries. This chapter presents some of the advantages and limitations of using RBF for water treatment. Design, cost, maintenance, and future research needs are presented.

TI Conceptualization of groundwater-surface water interaction with evidence
   from environmental isotopes and hydrogeochemistry in lake Babati Basin
   in Northern Tanzania
SO GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The holistic management of water resources is attainable with evidence-based planning constructed on reliable hydrological information. However, data paucity, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, leads to a significant knowledge gap regarding surface water and groundwater interactions, leaving considerable uncertainty to support relevant decisions. This study combined hydrogeochemistry and environmental isotopes to explore the connections between the surface water and groundwater in the data scarce catchment of Lake Babati Basin in northern Tanzania. The results showed that: i) Lake Babati receives groundwater influx from recently recharged aquifers endowed in the pyroclastic formation in the lake basin; ii) the lake is not well mixed as presented by the heterogenous hydrogeochemistry and confirmed by the differences in the isotopic composition of deuterium and oxygen - 18 at different locations within it; iii) the deep wells located near the lake abstract a mixture of recently recharged water, deep aquifer waters and lake water with enriched isotopic compositions; and iv) the hydro -geochemistry and isotopic data reveal the presence of a hydraulic connection between the lake and deep wells. The findings of this study demonstrate that the catchment, the groundwater system, and Lake Babati are interlinked and, therefore, require the implementation of integrated water resources management to enhance sustainable development.

TI Molecular detection of three gastroenteritis viruses in urban surface
   waters in Beijing and correlation with levels of fecal indicator
   bacteria
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB To assess the presence of three gastroenteritis viruses responsible for human acute gastroenteritis in surface water, a 1-year study was carried out in the city of Beijing, China. A total of 108 urban surface water samples were collected from nine collection sites which were defined with a global positioning system in rivers or lakes from September 2006 to August 2007. The water samples were subjected to virus concentration using an HA electronegative filter, followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for rotavirus (RV) astrovirus (AV), and norovirus (NV). It showed that the number of viruses detected in water samples from different sites was variable, totaling 63 virus strains, with rotavirus (48.1%) verified as the most prevalent detected, followed by astrovirus (AV, 5.6%), and norovirus (NV, 4.6%). RV was also quantified by real-time PCR and the concentration of RV ranged from 0 to 18.27 genome copies center dot L-1. And the distributions of RV in surface water were abundant in cold weather (from September to February) while less prevailing in warm weather (from March to August). The high detection rate of RV we encountered in this study provided convincing evidence that RV circulated at a certain frequency in the Beijing population. There was no statistically significant correlation between RV levels and both fecal coliform (R (2) = 0.02) and Enterococcus faecalis (R (2) = 0.02) densities. Our study suggests prolonged virus persistence in aquatic environments and emphasizes the enteric virus group as the most reliable for environmental monitoring.

TI Water Quality Deterioration and its Socio-economic Implications
SO JOURNAL OF PURE AND APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
AB From ancient times, people have chosen to live close to water sources, settling in river valleys. Improved water supply and water resources management boosts countries' economic growth and contributes greatly to poverty eradication. An adequate supply of safe drinking water is one of the major prerequisites for a healthy life but, because of surface water pollution, waterborne disease became, and still is, a major cause of death in many parts of the world, particularly, in children. Rapid urbanisation has exacerbated surface water pollution by increasing point pollution and non-point source pollution entering surface waterbodies. Physico-chemical and microbiological properties of water are used to assess water quality as they give a good impression of the status, productivity and sustainability of waterbodies. Water pollution control has been a matter of public concern for more than a century. Currently, human beings and natural ecosystems in many river basins suffer from debilitating effects of water pollution. Hence, development of better water conservation practices and policies are critical to the sustenance of our water both in terms of quantity and quality to ensure protection of public health.

TI Improved maps of surface water bodies, large dams, reservoirs, and lakes
   in China
SO EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
AB Data and knowledge of surface water bodies (SWB), including large lakes and reservoirs (surface water areas > 1 km(2)), are critical for the management and sustainability of water resources. However, the existing global or national dam datasets have large georeferenced coordinate offsets for many reservoirs, and some datasets have not reported reservoirs and lakes separately. In this study, we generated China's surface water bodies, Large Dams, Reservoirs, and Lakes (China-LDRL) dataset by analyzing all available Landsat imagery in 2019 (19 338 images) in Google Earth Engine and very-high spatial resolution imagery in Google Earth Pro. There were similar to 3.52 x 10(6) yearlong SWB polygons in China for 2019, only 0.01 x 10(6) of them (0.43 %) were of large size (> 1 km(2)). The areas of these large SWB polygons accounted for 83.54 % of the total 214.92 x 10(3) km(2) yearlong surface water area (SWA) in China. We identified 2418 large dams, including 624 off-stream dams and 1794 on-stream dams, 2194 large reservoirs (16.35 x 10(3) km(2)), and 3051 large lakes (73.38 x 10(3) km(2)). In general, most of the dams and reservoirs in China were distributed in South China, East China, and Northeast China, whereas most of lakes were located in West China, the lower Yangtze River basin, and Northeast China. The provision of the reliable, accurate China-LDRL dataset on large reservoirs/dams and lakes will enhance our understanding of water resources management and water security in China. The China-LDRL dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.16964656.v3 (Wang et al., 2021b).

TI Numerical simulation of the effect of heavy groundwater abstraction on
   groundwater-surface water interaction in Langat Basin, Selangor,
   Malaysia
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
AB The paper aims at evaluating the interaction between ground and surface water along the Langat River in Malaysia through the development of a numerical simulation. Malaysia has been experiencing a rapid economic growth since the last few decades, driven by many factors such as agriculture, industry, and the like. The demand for water in these sectors has increased so tremendously that surface water has been utilized in conjunction to groundwater. Approximately 18,184 m(3) of water per day is obtained from the aquifer to supply to the steel factory. There are also workshops, petroleum stations, and houses in the area thus causing the water quantity and quality to degrade. In terms of quantity, the pumping activity has altered the interaction between the groundwater and surface water. Therefore, a numerical model was proposed and two aquifer layers were simulated, with the first layer being approximately > 20 m in depth and the second layer > 100 m. The recharge estimated from the tank model was input into the groundwater modeling. The effects of the surface water to the aquifer were included in the simulation by defining the river conductance, river bed, and river level. The calibrated model (error about 0.9 m) was achieved and applied to predict the flow pattern in its natural state without the pumping and with the pumping states. As a result, in the first scenario, the stream was in an effluent condition influenced by the groundwater from the northeast to the west. A hyporheic flow occurred and was observed from the contour map. The flow system was changed in the second scenario when the pumping activity was included in the simulation. The groundwater lost its original function but received leakage from the stream near the pumping sites. The findings of this study will help the local authorities and other researchers to understand the aquifer system in the area and assist in the preparation of a sustainable groundwater management.

AB A decrease in deltaC-13(kerogen)) by 3 parts per thousand and increase in DELTAdeltaC-13 (carbonate-kerogen) by 1.2 parts per thousand has been observed in sediments at the K/T boundary substantiating the occurrence of a ''Strangelove Ocean'' wherein dissolved CO2 was enriched in C-12 because of mass mortality or reduced plankton production. A subsequent increase in deltaC-13(kerogen) by 7 parts per thousand and decrease in DELTAdeltaC-13(carbonate-kerogen) by 5.4 parts per thousand indicate a dramatic reduction in pCO2. This decrease could be the consequence of depletion of CO2 in surface waters because of unusual plankton blooms. These environmental changes which characterize the ''Strangelove Ocean'' occurred after the terminal Cretaceous event. During this time, rapid fluctuations in dissolved CO2 Of ocean surface waters may have caused significant perturbations in atmospheric pCO2 levels and consequently major instability of the global climate.

TI Prospects for reduction of the impact of wastewater discharge from urban
   areas on surface water quality in view of legal regulations
SO OCHRONA SRODOWISKA
AB Despite full adoption of EU requirements into current legal regulations in Poland, surface waters as sewage receivers in urban areas still cannot be considered fully protected, especially against contamination from sewer overflows and storm water systems. The examples discussed demonstrate that urban wastewater discharged from sewer overflows and storm water systems during rainfalls has a clearly dominant share in the load of pollutants emitted to the receiver. It is therefore important to develop efficient tools of water protection against these contaminants. Uniform but rather limited provisions applicable throughout the country do not take account of specific local conditions, especially size of wastewater receivers and size and characteristics of the catchment area, preventing therefore effective and economically viable water protection. The results of this research, carried out in Lodz, examining pollution loads discharged from the urban catchment area, illustrate that current approach to surface water protection issues requires a revision. Feasibility of regulatory changes in the area of setting requirements for effective receiver protection against pollutants discharged from urban areas was presented, considering the impact of untreated wastewater on the receiving water. It is also necessary to take comprehensive measures both in terms of research on pollutant emissions and their impact on the receiver and the method to utilize the results of such studies. This would enable more widespread use of urban wastewater discharge system modeling, which in turn would enable a reliable assessment of their impact on the receiver and taking appropriate modernization decisions. All of these activities are preconditions for sustainable rainwater management in urban areas.

TI URBANIZATION IMPAIRS SURFACE WATER QUALITY: EUTROPHICATION AND METAL
   STRESS IN THE GRAND CANAL OF CHINA
SO RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB Rapid urbanization leads to degradations upon water quality via eutrophication and pollution, but there are a lack of studies on patterns of water quality change to urbanization by level or process. China has achieved the most rapid urbanization in the world within the past three decades, and its urban development is diverse at level. Nine towns and cities at various development levels along the historic Grand Canal (approximately 1500 years old) were selected to reveal direct linkages between surface water quality and extent of urbanization. Surface water quality in the urban sections of the Grand Canal was impaired by both eutrophic nitrogen and phosphorus and metals. Although metals mostly remained at concentrations permissible to the Chinese National Environmental Standard for Surface Water Quality (GB3838-2002), the concentrations of metals in most urban canal water might impose an unacceptable effect on aquatic communities according to the Criterion Continuous Concentration from the National Recommended Water Quality Criteria for Priority Toxic Pollutants (US EPA 2006). The loadings of metals in the urban canal were found relating to local industrial activities. The level of urbanization, in this study, was significantly related to water quality parameters in a descending order of electrical conductivity > nutrients > metals. This study suggests that significant mitigation strategies are required for the Grand Canal of China for a sustainable urbanization goal. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Network design for surface water quality monitoring in a road

SO WATER RESOURCES AND INDUSTRY
AB Road construction has a negative environmental impact on the surrounding aquatic environment, requiring the continuous monitoring of surface water quality. Here, optimization of the water quality monitoring network (WQMN) is an essential step in supporting the sustainable development of road construction projects. This study introduces Gamma Test theory (GTT) as a practical method for optimizing the WQMN of surface waters during road construction. The water quality index (WQI) was computed in 48 monitoring stations for six monitoring periods from 2017 to 2019; data was acquired from a primary monitoring network over a new highway in southern Norway. Based on the results, it is possible to reduce the number of stations by 23% in comparison with the original empirical network. The proposed method could be useful to design the monitoring networks of projects with limited construction time and budget, as well as projects lacking enough data.

TI Differentiating the Effects of Climate Change-Induced Temperature and
   Streamflow Changes on the Vulnerability of Once-Through Thermoelectric
   Power Plants
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Thermoelectric power plants with once-through cooling systems generated 30% (similar to 300 GW) of U.S. electricity in 2016. Factors that reduce once-through cooling capacity and thus power output are environmental regulations, warming surface waters, and drought. The latter two may become more frequent as global climate changes. Previous research indicates that reduction in power plant capacity caused by environmental regulations can be significant while that by surface water warming is minor. Here, we address the effect of droughts on power output, which until now has remained conflated with temperature impacts. We do this using a widely used electricity generation model alongside hourly operational and meteorological data for 52 once-through plants located across the U.S. The effect of drought on plant output is examined for different water-availability and temperature scenarios, with and without regulations on plant water discharge. We find that if surface waters warm 3 degrees C and river discharges drop 20%, droughts would account for <= 20% capacity reduction depending on the plant, warming surface waters <= 2.3%, and environmental regulations up to 80%. This suggests that maintaining environmental regulations will require the continued conversion of plant cooling systems from once through to recirculating, and mitigating climate impacts will require more stringent drought-specific watershed management.

TI A Novel Freshwater to Marine Evolutionary Transition Revealed within
   Methylophilaceae Bacteria from the Arctic Ocean
SO MBIO
AB Bacteria inhabiting polar oceans, particularly the Arctic Ocean, are less studied than those at lower latitudes. Discovering bacterial adaptations to Arctic Ocean conditions is essential for understanding responses to the accelerated environmental changes occurring in the North. The Methylophilaceae are emerging as a model for investigating the genomic basis of habitat adaptation, because related lineages are widely distributed across both freshwater and marine ecosystems. Here, we investigated Methylophilaceae diversity in the salinity-stratified surface waters of the Canada Basin, Arctic Ocean. In addition to a diversity of marine OM43 lineages, we report on the genomic characteristics and evolution of a previously undescribed Methylophilaceae clade (BS01) common to polar surface waters yet related to freshwater sediment Methylotenera species. BS01 is restricted to the lower-salinity surface waters, while OM43 is found throughout the halocline. An acidic proteome supports a marine lifestyle for BS01, but gene content shows increased metabolic versatility compared to OM43 and evidence for ongoing genome-streamlining. Phylogenetic reconstruction shows that BS01 colonized the pelagic ocean independently of OM43 via convergent evolution. Salinity adaptation and differences in one-carbon and nitrogen metabolism may play a role in niche differentiation between BS01 and OM43. In particular, urea utilization by BS01 is predicted to provide an ecological advantage over OM43 given the limited amount of inorganic nitrogen in the Canada Basin. These observations provide further evidence that the Arctic Ocean is inhabited by distinct bacterial groups and that at least one group (BS01) evolved via a freshwater to marine environmental transition.
   IMPORTANCE Global warming is profoundly influencing the Arctic Ocean. Rapid ice melt and increased freshwater input is increasing ocean stratification, driving shifts in nutrient availability and the primary production that supports marine food webs. Determining bacterial responses to Arctic Ocean change is challenging because of limited knowledge on the specific adaptations of Arctic Ocean bacteria. In this study, we investigated the diversity and genomic adaptations of a globally distributed group of marine bacteria, the Methylophilaceae, in the surface waters of the Arctic Ocean. We discovered a novel lineage of marine Methylophilaceae inhabiting the Arctic Ocean whose evolutionary origin involved a freshwater to marine environmental transition. Crossing the salinity barrier is thought to rarely occur in bacterial evolution. However, given the ongoing freshening of the Arctic Ocean, our results suggest that these relative newcomers to the ocean microbiome increase in abundance and, therefore, ecological significance in a near-future Arctic Ocean.

TI Microplastics and associated PAHs in surface water from the Feilaixia
   Reservoir in the Beijiang River, China
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Microplastics have been a prevalent and persistent contamination problem in the global aquatic environment. In particular, microplastics that can adsorb persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and therefore transfer these POPs to organisms in the aquatic environment have received much attention. In this study, an investigation of microplastics in the surface water of the Feilaixia Reservoir (Guangdong Province, China), which is an important part of people's daily lives in Guangdong Province was carried out, mainly focusing on the characteristics and spatial distribution of microplastics, as well as microplastics and their adsorded PAHs in the surface water of the Feilaixia Reservoir were investigated. The average abundance of microplastics in the surface water of the Feilaixia Reservoir was 0.56 +/- 0.45 items/m(3). Six kinds of polymers, including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), were identified, among which PP (5231%) and PE (27.39%) were the major compositions. Four shapes of microplastics, i.e., foams, films, fragments and fibers were found, and films (37.78%) being the main shape. The most common typical size of the plastic particles ranged from 0.6 to 2 mm (41.36%). The total concentration of the sixteen PAHs carried on the EPS, PE and PP microplastics ranged from 282.4 to 427.3 ng/g; chrysene, benzo [ghi] perylene, and phenanthrene were abundant in the samples, at concentrations of 39.5-89.6 ng/g, 34.6-56.8 ng/g and 25.6-45.6 ng/g, respectively. Based on the ratios of the PAH isomers (Flut/Py <1 and Phe/Ant >10), it was speculated that the source of the PAHs may be derived from the imperfect combustion of fossil fuels. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Pesticide occurrence in protected surface waters in nature conservation
   areas of Germany
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB A complete ban on pesticide use in sensitive areas, such as nature conservation areas (NCA), is currently being debated in the EU as part of the Sustainable Use Regulation. NCA are strictly protected landscapes in Germany with minimal agricultural activity (<4.5 %) that serve as vital ecological refuges. However, it is largely unknown whether surface waters in German NCA are contaminated by pesticides. The current study uses extensive monitoring data (n = 3,822,553 measurements, 1998-2020, 208 pesticides) from the federal state of Saxony (18,416 km(2)), Germany, to characterize pesticide occurrence, contamination levels and risks (defined as exceedance of regulatory threshold levels) for surface waters in NCA (n = 68,277 measurements, mean size = 2.5 km(2)) in comparison to unprotected areas (n = 3,754,276). Pesticide detection frequencies show strong correlation between NCA and unprotected areas (UPA, R-2 = 0.70-0.92), but concentrations to be similar to 40 % lower in protected areas. Ecological risk distributions for three major species groups are similar between NCA and UPA (fish = 79.8 % overlap in density distribution, invertebrates = 78.6 %, plants = 81.9 %). Threshold exceedances differ greatly among groups (fish = 0.9 %, aquatic invertebrates = 14.7 %, plants = 20.4 %). Based on principal component analysis, ecological risks for aquatic plants and aquatic invertebrates are strongly correlated with upstream agricultural land use (80.5-82.4%) and are negatively correlated with upstream (semi)-natural land cover (90.1-97.3 %). Fluvial transport appears to be the most important pathway for contaminants into NCA surface waters, likely due to small conservation area size. Overall, surface waters in NCA are exposed to numerous organic contaminants causing ecological risks, highlighting the need to improve protection of these valuable water resources.

TI First nationwide investigation and environmental risk assessment of 72
   pharmaceuticals and personal care products from Sri Lankan surface
   waterways
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are known as an emerging class of water contaminants due to their potential adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we conducted the first nationwide survey to understand the distribution and environmental risk of 72 PPCPs in surface waterways of Sri Lanka. Forty-one out of 72 targeted compounds were detected with total concentrations ranging between 5.49 and 993 ng/L in surface waterways in Sri Lanka. The highest level of PPCP contamination was detected in an ornamental fish farm. Sulfamethoxazole was found with the highest concentration (934 ng/L) followed by N,N-diethyl-meta-oluamide (202 ng/L) and clarithromydn (119 ng/L). Didofenac, mefenamic add, ibuprofen, trimethoprim, and erythromycin were detected ubiquitously throughout the country. Our data revealed that hospital and domestic wastewater, and aquaculture activities potentially contribute to the presence of PPCPs in Sri Lankan waterways. The calculated risk quotients indicated that several locations face medium to high ecological risk to aquatic organisms from ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole, didofenac, mefenamic acid, tramadol, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, tridocarban, and tridosan. The aforementioned compounds could affect aquatic organisms from different trophic levels like algae, crustacean and fish, and also influence the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. These findings emphasize that a wide variety of pharmaceuticals have become pervasive environmental contaminants in the country. This data will serve to expand the inventory of global PPCP pollution. Further monitoring of PPCPs is needed in Sri Lanka in order to identify PPCP point sources and to implement strategies for contaminant reduction in wastewater to protect the aquatic ecosystem, wildlife, and human health.

TI Streamflow availability ratings identify surface water sources for
   groundwater recharge in the Central Valley
SO CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE
AB In California's semi-arid climate, replenishment of groundwater aquifers relies on precipitation and runoff during the winter season. However, climate projections suggest more frequent droughts and fewer years with above-normal precipitation, which may increase demand on groundwater resources and the need to recharge groundwater basins. Using historical daily streamflow data, we developed a spatial index and rating system of high-magnitude streamflow availability for groundwater recharge, STARR, in the Central Valley. We found that watersheds with excellent and good availability of excess surface water are primarily in the Sacramento River Basin and northern San Joaquin Valley. STARR is available as a web tool and can guide water managers on where and when excess surface water is available and, with other web tools, help sustainable groundwater agencies develop plans to balance water demand and aquifer recharge. However, infrastructure is needed to transport the water, and also changes to the current legal restrictions on use of such water.

TI Spatial variability of nitrate pollution and its sources in a hilly
   basin of the Yangtze River based on clustering
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Nitrate (NO3-) pollution is a serious global problem, and the quantitative analysis of its sources contributions is essential for devising effective water-related environmental-protection policies. The Shengjin Lake basin, located in the middle to lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China was selected as the research area in our study. We first grouped 29 surface water samples and 33 groundwater samples using cluster analysis, and then analyzed potential nitrate sources for each dataset of delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- isotope values by applying a Bayesian isotope-mixing model. Our results show that the nitrogen pollution in the surface-ground water in the study area seriously exceeded to class V of the Environmental Quality Standard of Surface Water of China. The NO3- in surface water from the mid-upper reaches of the drainage basin mainly originates from soil nitrogen (SN) and chemical fertilizer (CF), with contribution rates of 48% and 32%, respectively, and the NO3- in downstream areas mainly originates from CF and manure and sewage (MS), with contribution rates of 48% and 33%, respectively. For the groundwater samples, NO3- mainly originates from MS, CF, and SN in the mid-upper reaches of the drainage basin and the northside of Dadukou near the Yangtze River, with contribution rates of 34%, 31%, and 29%, respectively, whereas NO3- in the lower reaches and the middle part of Dadukou mainly originates from MS, with a contribution rate of 83%. The nitrogen conversion of surface water in lakes and in the mid-upper reaches is mainly affected by water mixing, while the groundwater and surface water in the lower plains are mainly affected by denitrification. The method proposed in this study can expand the ideas for tracking nitrate pollution in areas with complex terrain, and the relevant conclusions can provide a theoretical basis for surface and groundwater pollution control in the hilly basin of Yangtze River.

TI Is the Achievement of "Good Status" for German Surface Waters
   Disproportionately Expensive?-Comparing Two Approaches to Assess
   Disproportionately High Costs in the Context of the European Water
   Framework Directive
SO WATER
AB Currently only 8.2% of German surface water bodies have reached the goal of the European Water Framework Directive to bring all water into a "good status". For all water bodies that presumably will not achieve the objective by 2027, the member states have to justify an exemption by 2021, for example, by arguing that the costs of achieving "good status" would be "disproportionately high". In this paper, two approaches for assessing cost-disproportionality of surface water bodies are empirically tested and compared on a set of real-world data from a German federal state. In the first approach, called average cost approach, costs are considered as being disproportionately high if they are significantly higher than what would be a "relatively normal effort". The core idea of the second, the benchmark approach, is to take the past public expenditures on water management as a basis for comparison. Both approaches include generated utility for determination of a water-body-specific disproportionality threshold. While the benchmarking approach needs less data, the empirical tests indicate that both approaches yield comparable results and are suitable to support authorities in the decision as to which water bodies are to be considered disproportionately expensive such that exemptions are justified.

TI Modeling the improvement of ultrafiltration membrane mass transfer when
   using biofiltration pretreatment in surface water applications
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB In surface water treatment, ultrafiltration (UF) membranes are widely used because of their ability to supply safe drinking water. Although UF membranes produce high-quality water, their efficiency is limited by fouling. Improving UF filtrate productivity is economically desirable and has been attempted by incorporating sustainable biofiltration processes as pretreatment to UF with varying success. The availability of models that can be applied to describe the effectiveness of biofiltration on membrane mass transfer are lacking. In this work, UF water productivity was empirically modeled as a function of biofilter feed water quality using either a quadratic or Gaussian relationship. OF membrane mass transfer variability was found to be governed by the dimensionless mass ratio between the alkalinity (ALK) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). UF membrane productivity was optimized when the biofilter feed water ALK to DOC ratio fell between 10 and 14. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The management of groundwater resources in England and Wales was initially based only on measures of the renewable resource. This has been extended to include the need to preserve the springs, river flows and surface water levels dependent on groundwater discharges as a key objective of a sustainable management of groundwater resources. The impacts of all new groundwater abstraction proposals on the surface water environment are now evaluated using a number of techniques, some of which are under further development. The sustainable management of groundwater catchments also includes the control of pumping from existing groundwater sources to meet agreed environmental targets. This approach is illustrated by examples of groundwater catchments managed to augment surface flows, to prevent saline intrusion and to preserve the integrity of wetland conservation sites.

TI Effects of hydrologic changes on aboveground production and surface
   water chemistry in two boreal peatlands in Alberta: Implications for
   global warming
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB Aboveground net primary production (NPP) and surface water chemistry variables were monitored in a lacustrine sedge fen and a bog for four years. There were no significant differences in precipitation, mean growing season annual temperature, and number of growing degree days from 1991 to 1994. The mean annual water levels in the lacustrine sedge fen differed significantly, whereas they were similar in the bog during these four years. We measured 15 surface water variables in the lacustrine sedge fen and the bog, and found that only two correlated significantly with water level fluctuations. In the lacustrine sedge fen, calcium correlated positively (r(2) = 0.56) and nitrate correlated negatively (r(2) = 0.20) with water levels. In the bog, potassium correlated positively (r(2) = 0.88) and total dissolved phosphorus correlated negatively (r(2) = 0.62) with water levels. The remaining chemical variables showed no significant correlations with water level fluctuations.
   Net primary production of the different vegetation strata appeared to respond to different environmental variables. In the lacustrine sedge fen, graminoid production was explained to a significant degree by water levels (r(2) = 0.53), whereas shrub production was explained to a significant degree by surface water chemistry variables, such as nitrate (r(2) = 0.74) and total phosphorus (r(2) = 0.22). In the bog, temperature was the only variable that explained moss production to a significant degree (r(2) = 0.71), whereas ammonium explained graminoid production (r(2) = 0.66) and soluble reactive phosphorus explained shrub production to significant degrees (r(2) = 0.71).
   There are few direct data on the impact of climatic warming in boreal wetlands, although paleoecological and 2xCO(2) model data have provided some indications of past and possibly future changes in vegetation composition, respectively. Our results suggest that the lacustrine sedge fen may succeed to a bog dominated by Sphagnum spp. and Picea mariana, whereas the bog may succeed to an upland-type forest ecosystem.

TI Modelling Dynamic Hydrological Connectivity in the Zoige Area (China)
   Based on Multi-Temporal Surface Water Observation
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB The sustainability of wetlands is threatened by the past and present land use practices. Hydrological connectivity is one of the most important aspects to consider for wetland rehabilitation planning purposes. Circuit theory and connectivity indices can be used to model and assess hydrological connectivity. The aim of this study was to assess spatiotemporal variation in the hydrological connectivity of the Zoige area from 2000-2019 using both methods. The study area contains a Ramsar wetland of international importance, namely the Sichuan Ruoergai Wetland National Nature Reserve. We used a global surface water observation product as the major input for both methods, and then analyzed the temporal and spatial characteristics, in terms of important components and patches. We found that the overall connectivity has increased slightly in the last 20 years, while the probability of connection between patches of surface water has increased significantly. Important components and patches represent steppingstone habitat for the dispersal of organisms in the landscape. The main determinants of hydrological connectivity are mostly human oriented, predominantly a decrease in large livestock population size and population increase.

TI Risk-indexed herbicide taxes to reduce ground and surface water
   pollution: an integrated ecological economics evaluation
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Public policy toward pesticide use in agriculture can benefit from data coming from models that integrate ecological and economic constraints into cropping decisions and pesticide use. Herein we use such a model to focus on the environmental and economic effectiveness of a specific set of tools used to promote sustainable agriculture with less pesticide runoff - incentive-based instruments created by risk-indexed herbicide input-taxes. We measure risk by health advisory levels and by an ecological economic simulation model that estimates predicted exposure levels. We explore whether this innovative solution or herbicide input-taxes does better at reducing losses to farm net returns, and surface and groundwater loadings than quantity restrictions. Using the integrated CEEPES model, our results suggest that risk-indexed input taxes by information about individual herbicide exposure levels can be a cost-effective tool to reduce predicted groundwater exposures. No single policy, however, was efficient at simultaneously improving groundwater and surface water quality. Instead we construct an efficient policy set. We find exposure-induced taxes were most efficient for small percentage reductions in overall exposure, bans were efficient for medium reductions, and flat taxes were efficient for high reductions.

TI Monitoring Water-Related Ecosystems with Earth Observation Data in
   Support of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 Reporting
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Lack of national data on water-related ecosystems is a major challenge to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 targets by 2030. Monitoring surface water extent, wetlands, and water quality from space can be an important asset for many countries in support of SDG 6 reporting. We demonstrate the potential for Earth observation (EO) data to support country reporting for SDG Indicator 6.6.1, 'Change in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time' and identify important considerations for countries using these data for SDG reporting. The spatial extent of water-related ecosystems, and the partial quality of water within these ecosystems is investigated for seven countries. Data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat 5, 7, and 8 with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) are used to measure surface water extent at 250 m and 30 m spatial resolution, respectively, in Cambodia, Jamaica, Peru, the Philippines, Senegal, Uganda, and Zambia. The extent of mangroves is mapped at 30 m spatial resolution using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-1, and SRTM data for Jamaica, Peru, and Senegal. Using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A imagery, total suspended solids and chlorophyll-a are mapped over time for a select number of large surface water bodies in Peru, Senegal, and Zambia. All of the EO datasets used are of global coverage and publicly available at no cost. The temporal consistency and long time-series of many of the datasets enable replicability over time, making reporting of change from baseline values consistent and systematic. We find that statistical comparisons between different surface water data products can help provide some degree of confidence for countries during their validation process and highlight the need for accuracy assessments when using EO-based land change data for SDG reporting. We also raise concern that EO data in the context of SDG Indicator 6.6.1 reporting may be more challenging for some countries, such as small island nations, than others to use in assessing the extent of water-related ecosystems due to scale limitations and climate variability. Country-driven validation of the EO data products remains a priority to ensure successful data integration in support of SDG Indicator 6.6.1 reporting. Multi-country studies such as this one can be valuable tools for helping to guide the evolution of SDG monitoring methodologies and provide a useful resource for countries reporting on water-related ecosystems. The EO data analyses and statistical methods used in this study can be easily replicated for country-driven validation of EO data products in the future.

The upper reach of the Hun River is an important water source that supplies 52 % of the storage capacity of the Dahuofang Reservoir, the largest reservoir for drinking water in Northeast China, which is suffering from various human-induced changes in land use, including deforestation, reclamation/farming, urbanization and mine exploitation. To investigate the impacts of land use types on surface water quality across an anthropogenic disturbance gradient at a local scale, 11 physicochemical parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen [DO], turbidity, oxygen redox potential, conductivity, biochemical oxygen demand [BOD5], chemical oxygen demand [COD], total nitrogen [TN], total phosphorus [TP], NO (3) (-) -N, and NH (4) (+) -N) of water from 12 sampling sites along the upper reach of the Hun River were monitored monthly during 2009-2010. The sampling sites were classified into four groups (natural, near-natural, more disturbed, and seriously disturbed). The water quality exhibited distinct spatial and temporal characteristics; conductivity, TN, and NO (3) (-) -N were identified as key parameters indicating the water quality variance. The forest and farmland cover types played significant roles in determining the surface water quality during the low-flow, high-flow, and mean-flow periods based on the results of a stepwise linear regression. These results may provide incentive for the local government to consider sustainable land use practices for water conservation.

TI Occurrences, transport drivers, and risk assessments of antibiotics in
   typical oasis surface and groundwater
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Intensive use of antibiotics affects biogeochemical cycles and stimulates the evolution of antibiotic resistance, thus threatening global health and social development. The spatiotemporal distributions of antibiotics in single aqueous matrices have been widely documented; however, their occurrence in surface-groundwater systems has received less attention, especially in arid regions that usually have fragile ecosystems. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of thirty-one antibiotics in the surface water and adjacent groundwater in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. The results showed that the total concentrations of detected antibiotics varied from 17.37 to 84.09 ng L-1 and from 16.38 to 277.41 ng L-1 in surface and groundwater, respectively. The median concentration of antibiotics showed the pattern of norfloxacin (4.86 ng L-1) ciprofloxacin (3.93 ng L-1) > pefloxacin (3.39 ng L-1) in surface water; whereas in groundwater, this was in the order of pefloxacin (6.30 ng L-1) > norfloxacin (4.33 ng L-1) > ciprofloxacin (2.68 ng L-1). Heatmap analysis indicated that vertical infil-tration had limited effects on antibiotic exchange in surface-ground water systems because of the high potential evaporation and low water storage. Redundancy analysis suggested that the oxidation-reduction potential (p < 0.01) and dissolved oxygen (p < 0.05) jointly affected the distribution of antibiotics in surface water. Ecological risk assessment showed that antibiotics in 98.9% of surface water and 99.1% of groundwater did not pose sig-nificant risks to aquatic species. The findings of this study will help develop effective mitigation strategies for antibiotics in aquatic environments.

TI Residues, potential source and ecological risk assessment of polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in surface water of the East Liao River,
   Jilin Province, China
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The environmental risks posed by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the diversity of their anthropogenic origins make them a global issue. Therefore, it is of utmost significance for protecting the aquatic environment and the growth of neighboring populations to identify their possible origins and ecological risk. Here, we detail the contamination profiles of 15 PAHs found in the East Liao River's surface waters in Jilin Province and use the receptor model Absolute Principal Component Analysis - Multiple Linear Regression (APCS-MLR) and diagnostic ratios method to identify the primary potential sources of pollution. Based on the natural hazard risk formation theory (NHRFT), an ecological risk assessment (ERA) model for PAHs in the East Liao River was developed. The method assesses the ecological risk status of PAHs by integrating the risk quotient (RQ) approach and the DPSIRM (driving force, pressure, state, impact, response, management) conceptual framework. Total concentrations in the surface water body were between 396.42 and 624.06 ng/L, with an average of 436.99 ng/L. The source research revealed that coal, biomass, and traffic emission sources are the most likely PAH contributors to the East Liao River. The ERA found that the majority of the sites' locations of the study were at low risk for PAHs in surface water bodies (30.7 % and 32.2 %, respectively), while only a tiny percentage of sites were at high or very high risk (1.8 % and 13.6 %). The study results provide theoretical support for the East Liao River's ecological, environmental protection, and policy formulation.

TI Optimizing conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater for
   irrigation to address human-nature water conflicts: A surrogate modeling
   approach
SO AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB In arid and semi-arid areas where agriculture competes keenly with ecosystem for water, integrated management of both surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) resources at a basin scale is crucial, but often lacks scientific support. This study implemented physically-based, fully integrated SW-GW modeling in optimizing water management, and performed surrogate modeling to replace the computationally expensive model with simple response surfaces. Water use conflicts between agriculture and ecosystem in Heihe River Basin (HRB), the second largest inland river basin in China, were investigated. Based on the integrated model GSFLOW (Coupled Ground-Water and Surface-Water Flow Model), the conjunctive use of SW and GW for irrigation in the study area was optimized using a surrogate-based approach named DYCORS (Dynamic COordinate search using Response Surface models). Overall, the study demonstrated that, with the surrogate modeling approach, an expensive integrated model could be efficiently incorporated into an optimization analysis, and the integrated modeling would make feasible a physically based interpretation of the optimization results. In the HRB case study, the surrogate-based optimization suggested a very different time schedule of water diversion in opposite to the existing one, indicating the critical role of SW-GW interactions in the water cycle. With the temporal optimization, a basin-scale water saving could be achieved by reducing non-beneficial evapotranspiration. In addition, the current flow regulation in HRB may not be sustainable, because the ecosystem recovery in the lower HRB would be at the cost of the ecosystem degradation in the middle HRB.

TI Potential impacts of a future Nordic bioeconomy on surface water quality
SO AMBIO
AB Nordic water bodies face multiple stressors due to human activities, generating diffuse loading and climate change. The 'green shift' towards a bio-based economy poses new demands and increased pressure on the environment. Bioeconomy-related pressures consist primarily of more intensive land management to maximise production of biomass. These activities can add considerable nutrient and sediment loads to receiving waters, posing a threat to ecosystem services and good ecological status of surface waters. The potential threats of climate change and the 'green shift' highlight the need for improved understanding of catchment-scale water and element fluxes. Here, we assess possible bioeconomy-induced pressures on Nordic catchments and associated impacts on water quality. We suggest measures to protect water quality under the 'green shift' and propose 'road maps' towards sustainable catchment management. We also identify knowledge gaps and highlight the importance of long-term monitoring data and good models to evaluate changes in water quality, improve understanding of bioeconomy-related impacts, support mitigation measures and maintain ecosystem services.

TI Detection of potentially pathogenic enteric viruses in environmental
   samples from Kenya using the bag-mediated filtration system
SO WATER SUPPLY
AB Enteric virus environmental surveillance via a highly sensitive method is critical, as many enteric viruses have low infectious doses and can persist in the environment for extended periods. This study determined the potential of the novel bag-mediated filtration system (BMFS) to recover human enteric viruses and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) from wastewater and wastewater-impacted surface waters, examined PMMoV use as a fecal contamination indicator in Kenya, and identified potential BMFS process controls. From April 2015 to April 2016, BMFS samples were collected from seven sites in Kenya (n = 59). Enteroviruses and PMMoV were detected in 100% of samples, and human adenovirus, human astrovirus, hepatitis A virus, norovirus GI, norovirus GII, sapovirus, and human rotavirus were detected in the majority of samples. The consistent detection of enteroviruses and PMMoV suggests that these viruses could be used as indicators in similarly fecally contaminated sites and BMFS process controls. As contamination of surface water sources remains a global issue, enteric virus environmental surveillance is necessary. This study demonstrates an effective way to sample large volumes of wastewater and wastewater-impacted surface waters for the detection of multiple enteric viruses simultaneously.

TI The environmental cost of a reference withdrawal from surface waters:
   Definition and geography
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
AB World freshwater ecosystems are significantly deteriorating at a faster rate than other ecosystems. Water withdrawals are recognized as one of the main drivers of growing water stress in river basins worldwide. Over the years, much effort has been devoted to quantify water withdrawals at a global scale; however, comparisons are not simple because the uneven spatiotemporal distribution of surface water resources entails that the same amount of consumed water does not have the same environmental cost in different times or places. In order to account for this spatiotemporal heterogeneity, this work proposes a novel index to assess the environmental cost of a withdrawal from a generic river section. The index depends on (i) the environmental relevance of the impacted fluvial ecosystem (e.g., bed-load transport capacity, width of the riparian belt, biodiversity richness) and (ii) the downstream river network affected by the water withdrawal. The environmental cost has been estimated in each and every river section worldwide considering a reference withdrawal. Being referred to a unitary reference withdrawal that can occur in any river section worldwide, our results can be suitably arranged for describing any scenario of surface water consumption (i.e., as the superposition of the actual pattern of withdrawals). The index aims to support the interpretation of the volumetric measure of surface water withdrawal with a perspective that takes into account the fluvial system where the withdrawal actually occurs. The application of the index highlights the river regions where withdrawals can cause higher environmental costs, with the challenge of weighting each water withdrawal considering the responsibilities that it has on downstream freshwater ecosystems.

TI Developing an optimized groundwater exploitation prediction model based
   on the Harris hawk optimization algorithm for conjunctive use of surface
   water and groundwater resources
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Due to the lack of surface water and groundwater resources, especially in the agricultural parts, the simultaneous and sustainable use of water resources to supply water demands is essential. In this study, a conjunctive use optimization model is developed to minimize the shortage of water demand. This model is implemented for the Mahabad study area in northwestern Iran to improve the conditions of surface water and groundwater resources and the reclamation of Urmia Lake. For this purpose, the current research is accomplished in three parts. At first, the Mahabad aquifer is numerically simulated to investigate the aquifer conditions. In the second part, the optimized model of conjunctive use obtained by the Harris hawk optimization (HHO) algorithm is investigated over a 20-year period in the study area. In the last part of this research, seven scenarios are developed to predict the optimized groundwater exploitation (OGE) using the results of HHO, meteorological data, and some input information on the dam reservoir. Then, the OGE values are predicted using the artificial neural network (ANN) and ANN-HHO machine learning models for the scenarios. The results showed that the scenario that includes all input variables and the ANN-HHO model outperformed other models. Furthermore, the HHO algorithm provides suitable allocation of the surface water and groundwater resources in optimized conjunctive use and also improves the performance of ANN in predicting the OGE values. The findings of this study also show that groundwater resources can be more applied to supply water demand, and in contrast, surface water resources can be used for supplying downstream environmental demands and reclamation of Urmia Lake.

AB NASA and the French space agency, CNES, with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency ( CSA) and United Kingdom Space Agency ( UKSA) are developing new wide swath altimetry technology that will cover most of the world's ocean and surface freshwater bodies. The proposed Surface Water and Ocean Topography ( SWOT) mission will have the capability to make observations of surface water ( lakes, rivers, wetland) heights and measurements of ocean surface topography with unprecedented spatial coverage, temporal sampling, and spatial resolution compared to existing technologies. These data will be useful for monitoring the hydrologic cycle, flooding, and characterizing human impacts on a changing environment.
   The applied science community is a key element in the success of the SWOT mission, demonstrating the high value of the science and data products in addressing societal issues and needs. The SWOT applications framework includes a working group made up of applications specialists, SWOT science team members, academics and SWOT Project members to promote applications research and engage a broad community of potential SWOT data users. A defined plan and a guide describing a program to engage early adopters in using proxies for SWOT data, including sophisticated ocean and hydrology simulators, an airborne analogue for SWOT ( AirSWOT), and existing satellite datasets, are cornerstones for the program. A user survey is in development and the first user workshop was held in 2015, with annual workshops planned.
   The anticipated science and engineering advances that SWOT will provide can be transformed into valuable services to decision makers and civic organizations focused on addressing global disaster risk reduction initiatives and potential science-based mitigation activities for water resources challenges of the future. With the surface water measurements anticipated from SWOT, a broad range of applications can inform inland and coastal managers and marine operators of terrestrial and oceanic phenomena relevant to their work.

TI Strategic Evaluation Tool for Surface Water Quality Management Remedies
   in Drinking Water Catchments
SO WATER
AB Drinking water catchments (DWC) are under pressure from point and nonpoint source pollution due to the growing human activities. This worldwide challenge is causing number of adverse effects, such as degradation in water quality, ecosystem health, and other economic and social pressures. Different evaluation tools have been developed to achieve sustainable and healthy drinking water catchments. However, a holistic and strategic framework is still required to adequately consider the uncertainty associated with feasible management remedies of surface water quality in drinking water catchments. A strategic framework was developed to adequately consider the uncertainty associated with management remedies for surface water quality in drinking water catchments. A Fuzzy Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (FMCDA) approach was embedded into a strategic decision support framework to evaluate and rank water quality remediation options within a typical fixed budget constraint faced by bulk water providers. The evaluation framework consists of four core aspects; namely, water quality, environmental, economic and social, and number of associated quantitative and qualitative criteria and sub-criteria. Final remediation strategy ranking was achieved through the application of the Euclidean Distance by the In-center of Centroids (EDIC).

TI Invertebrates are declining in boreal aquatic habitat: The effect of
   brownification?
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Surface water browning affects boreal lakes in the Northern Hemisphere. This process is expected to increase with global warming. Boreal lakes are the most numerous lakes on Earth. These ecosystems are particularly sensitive to disturbances due to their low biodiversity compared to other aquatic environments. The recent darkening of surface water is expected to hinder key ecosystem processes, particularly through lower primary productivity and loss of biodiversity. However, studies based on long-term data collections have rarely been conducted on the ecological consequences of water browning on aquatic food webs, especially concerning its impacts on invertebrate communities.
   For the first time, our analysis based on two decades of data collection in Finnish lakes highlighted a relation between water browning and a decline in aquatic macroinvertebrate abundances. Aquatic invertebrates are the main food resource for many secondary predators such as fish and waterbirds, hence such effect on their populations may have major consequences for boreal ecosystem functioning.<bold> </bold>

TI Conjunctive use of water resources for sustainable irrigated agriculture
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB The continuous increase in global population and simultaneous decrease in good quality water resources emphasizes the need of using surface water and groundwater resources conjunctively for irrigation. The conjunctive use allows the utilization of poor quality water, which cannot be used as such for the crop production due to its harmful effect on soil and crop health. This paper presents an overview on issues and methods of the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater resources for sustainable irrigated agriculture. The background of the conjunctive water use and its applications for the management of poor quality water and management of rising watertable are presented. The management of conjunctive water use through the computer-based models is also covered in this review. The advantages and disadvantages of the approach have been described. Conclusions are provided based on this review which could be useful for all the stakeholders. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Molecular identity of strains of heterotrophic flagellates isolated from
   surface waters and deep-sea sediments of the South Atlantic based on SSU
   rDNA
SO AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB Whereas much is known about the biodiversity of prokaryotes and macroorganisms in the deep sea, knowledge on the biodiversity of protists, remains very limited. Molecular studies have changed our view of marine environments and have revealed an astonishing number of previously unknown eukaryotic organisms. Morphological findings have shown that at least some widely distributed nanoflagellates can also be found in the deep sea. Whether these flagellates have contact with populations from other habitats is still uncertain. We performed a molecular comparison of strains isolated from deep-sea sediments (>5000 m depth) and surface waters on the basis of their small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA). Sequences of Rhynchomonas nasuta, Amastigomonas debruynei, Ancyromonas sigmoides, Cafeteria roenbergensis and Caecitellus parvulus were analysed, and 2 contrasting results obtained. Firstly, we found nearly identical genotypes within 1 morphospecies (C. roenbergensis), and secondly, quite different genotypes within certain morphospecies (R. nasuta, A. sigmoides and C. parvulus). In addition, high genetic distances between the different strains of A. sigmoides and C. parvulus indicate that these morphospecies should be divided into different at least genetically distinguishable species. In contrast, some heterotrophic nanoflagellates must indeed be regarded as being cosmopolitan. According to the low genetic distances between isolates of R, nasuta, A. debruynei and C. roenbergensis as well as between our isolates of A. sigmoides from deep-sea and surface waters, exchanges between these habitats and also on a global scale might be possible. In summary, our results show that 3 morphospecies obviously contain several cryptic species, while some of the investigated genotypes occur in both deep-sea as well as in surface waters.

TI Integrated Hydrologic Modeling to Untangle the Impacts of Water
   Management During Drought
SO GROUNDWATER
AB Over the past century, groundwater levels in California's San Joaquin Valley have dropped by more than 30 m in some areas mostly due to excessive groundwater extraction used to irrigate agricultural lands and sustain a growing population. Between 2012 and 2015, California experienced the worst drought in its recorded history, depleting surface water supplies and further exacerbating groundwater depletion in the region. Due to a lack of groundwater regulation, exact quantities of extracted groundwater in California are unknown and hard to quantify. Recent adoption of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act has intensified efforts to identify sustainable groundwater use. However, understanding sustainable use in a highly productive agricultural system with an extremely complex surface water allocation system, variable groundwater use, and spatially extensive and diverse irrigation practices is no easy task. Using an integrated hydrologic model coupled with a land surface model, we evaluated how water management activities, specifically a suite of irrigation and groundwater pumping scenarios, impact surface water-groundwater fluxes and storage components and how those activities and the relationships between them change during drought. Results showed that groundwater pumping volume had the most significant impact on long-term water storage changes. A comparison with total water storage anomaly (TWSA) estimates from NASA's Gravity Recover and Climate Experiment (GRACE) provided some insight regarding which combinations of pumping and irrigation matched the GRACE TWSA estimates, lending credibility to these scenarios. In addition, the majority of long-term water storage changes during the recent drought occurred in groundwater storage in the deeper subsurface.

TI Developments in Earth observation for the assessment and monitoring of
   inland, transitional, coastal and shelf-sea waters
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The Earth's surface waters are a fundamental resource and encompass a broad range of ecosystems that are core to global biogeochemical cycling and food and energy production. Despite this, the Earth's surface waters are impacted by multiple natural and anthropogenic pressures and drivers of environmental change. The complex interaction between physical, chemical and biological processes in surface waters poses significant challenges for in situ monitoring and assessment and often limits our ability to adequately capture the dynamics of aquatic systems and our understanding of their status, functioning and response to pressures. Here we explore the opportunities that Earth observation (EO) has to offer to basin-scale monitoring of water quality over the surface water continuum comprising inland, transition and coastal water bodies, with a particular focus on the Danube and Black Sea region. This review summarises the technological advances in EO and the opportunities that the next generation satellites offer for water quality monitoring. We provide an overview of algorithms for the retrieval of water quality parameters and demonstrate how such models have been used for the assessment and monitoring of inland, transitional, coastal and shelf-sea systems. Further, we argue that very few studies have investigated the connectivity between these systems especially in large river-sea systems such as the Danube-Black Sea. Subsequently, we describe current capability in operational processing of archive and near real-time satellite data. We conclude that while the operational use of satellites for the assessment and monitoring of surface waters is still developing for inland and coastal waters and more work is required on the development and validation of remote sensing algorithms for these optically complex waters, the potential that these data streams offer for developing an improved, potentially paradigm-shifting understanding of physical and biogeochemical processes across large scale river-sea systems including the Danube-Black Sea is considerable.

TI Numerical modeling of groundwater flow system in the Modjo River
   catchment, Central Ethiopia
SO MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB In recent years, groundwater pumping has increased for domestic, industrial, and irrigation use in the Modjo River catchment. Understanding changes in groundwater levels is crucial for the sustainable use and management of aquifer. This study investigates the groundwater flow system and aquifer response to increased groundwater pumping and reduced recharge using the calibrated steady-state groundwater level and budget as a baseline. The groundwater flow corresponds to the direction of the Modjo River flow, following the topographic gradient. The simulated groundwater budget indicates that recharge from precipitation and surface water (crater lakes and river) are the main inflow to the aquifer, while the outflow from the aquifer is due to groundwater pumping, natural subsurface flow to downstream area, and base flow. Analysis of the different scenarios reveals that both an increase in well pumping and a decline in recharge resulted in a decrease of the base flow to Bishoftu crater lakes and Mojo River, and to the downstream subsurface flow. In conclusion, increasing human demand for groundwater and variability in recharge will affect groundwater contribution to surface water and ultimately will be a source of concern in the future for both environmental flows and groundwater management.

TI Long-term surface water changes and driving cause in Xiong'an, China:
   from dense Landsat time series images and synthetic analysis
SO SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB China's government statement recently reported the plan of constructing Xiong'an New Area, which aims to phase out some extra capital functions from Beijing and to explore an innovative urban development mode with the priority in eco-environmental protection. The New Area is located in the semi-arid North China Plain (NCP) and is home to NCP's largest natural freshwater wetland, Baiyangdian Lake. A comprehensive realization of surface water dynamics would be crucial for policy-makers to outline a sustainable environment development strategy for New Area. In this study, we used a total of 245 time slices of cloud-free Landsat images to document the continuous changes of water bodies within Xiong'an City during 1984-2016 and to provide detailed evidence of water presence and persistency states and changes under the influences of climate change and human actions. Our results reveal that the New Area water body areas varied dramatically during the past 33 years, ranging from 0.44 km(2) in April 1988 to 317.85 km(2) in February 1989. The change of surface water area was not characterized by a monotonically decreasing tendency. The evolution processes can be divided into four sub-stages: the first extreme desiccation in mid-1980s, the wet stage with the most extensive inundation areas and strong inter-annual fluctuations from late-1988 to late 1999, another desiccation stage in early 2000s, and the overall recovering stage between 2007 and 2016. We also mapped the maximum water inundation extents and frequencies of all-season, pre-wet season (February-May) and post-wet season (September-December) for the 33 years and different sub-periods. Although there is good agreement between time series of surface water area evolution in the New Area and station-based precipitation and evaporation variations, multiple lines of evidences reviewed in previous research indicate that the degraded Baiyangdian Lake was also tightly associated with human activities from various aspects, including dam construction, groundwater extraction, agricultural irrigation, etc. We highlighted the current status of exploring the driving mechanism of surface water changes and existing problems, and then offer recommendations.

TI Riverbank Filtration: A Sustainable Process to Attenuate Contaminants
   during Drinking Water Production
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF ENERGY WATER AND ENVIRONMENT
   SYSTEMS-JSDEWES
AB Riverbank filtration leads to purification of water. For India it can be a simple, economical and effective alternative. A few unanswered questions were: Can it work in Indian mountainous regions? Will it be of any advantage in the case of some of the polluted Indian surface waters? With the goal to evaluate use of riverbank filtration as a sustainable technology under widely varying conditions prevalent in India, the effectiveness of riverbank filtration has been examined over the last 10 years. In the case of cleaner surface waters, the wells deliver water free of turbidity and coliform even during monsoon irrespective of well configuration. In the case of polluted source waters, it results in an overall advantage in terms of improved raw water quality, reduced degree and cost of subsequent treatment and decreased levels of disinfection by-products. The study shows riverbank filtration to be an effective and sustainable option for plains as well as the mountainous region.

TI Survey of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in surface waters of Poland
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS
   SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
AB Perfluorochemicals (PFCs) are wide-spread contaminants on a global scale. There is an increasingly growing number of data on environmental occurrence, sources and risk of PFCs to humans and aquatic biota in highly industrialised countries but inadequate information exists for less industrialised regions. In the present study, concentrations and profiles of PFCs were examined in surface waters (rivers, lakes, streams, coastal region of the Baltic Sea) of Poland. PFOS was the dominant compound found in water at most of the sites surveyed and its concentration varied between <0.5 and 150 ng/L and next was PFHxS with <0.25 to 110 ng/L, while at much smaller concentration of <0.5 to 18 ng/L occurred PFOA. The long-chain carboxylates (C11-C16) could be found only in water of a drainage ditch near to the Sarzyna site, i.e., PFUnDA occurred at 0.17 ng/L, PFTeDA of 0.06 ng/L, PFDoDA at 0.1 ng/L and PFHxDA at 0.12 ng/L. PFDA was found at several locations in the Gulf of Gdansk and its concentration varied between <0.01 and 0.07 ng/L. The profile of PFCs in surface water at several sites of Poland with PFOS as a major compound, followed by PFOA is similar to that reported for other countries in Europe as well as for India, while this is different from that of Korea, Japan and the USA, where PFOA was the predominant contaminant.

TI Modelling of metaldehyde concentrations in surface waters: A travel time
   based approach
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB Diffuse agricultural pollution is widely recognized as a significant threat to the quality of water resources. Metaldehyde is a soluble synthetic aldehyde pesticide used globally in agriculture which has caused recent concern due to high observed levels (exceeding the European and UK standards for pesticides in drinking water value of 0.1 mu g/1) in surface waters utilized for potable water supply. This paper describes the development of a new travel time based physically distributed metaldehyde prediction model which aims to describe the short term fluctuations of metaldehyde concentrations in surface waters caused by rainfall runoff events. This will enable water infrastructure operators to consider informed control decisions in order to improve the quality of abstracted surface water. The methodology is developed and trailed within a case study catchment in the UK. The new approach integrates spatially and temporally disaggregated surface runoff generation, routing and build-up/wash-off concepts using a simple structure in a GIS environment to build a metaldehyde concentration prediction model. The use of 1 km(2) resolution radar rainfall data and identification of high risk areas in the catchment provide an approach which considers the spatio-temporal variations of pollutant generation and transport in the catchment. The model is calibrated and validated using available catchment flow and a new metaldehyde concentration dataset acquired using automatic samplers over four rainfall events. An average coefficient of determination and model efficiency of 0.75 and 0.46 respectively have been obtained for the rainfall events used to validate the model. This shows the capability of the model for the intended purpose of predicting the arrival of peak metaldehyde concentrations at surface water abstraction sites and informing abstraction decisions.

TI Aquifers and hyporheic zones: Towards an ecological understanding of
   groundwater
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Ecological constraints in subsurface environments relate directly to groundwater flow, hydraulic conductivity, interstitial biogeochemistry, pore size, and hydrological linkages to adjacent aquifers and surface ecosystems. Groundwater ecology has evolved from a science describing the unique subterranean biota to its current form emphasising multidisciplinary studies that integrate hydrogeology and ecology. This multidisciplinary approach seeks to elucidate the function of groundwater ecosystems and their roles in maintaining subterranean and surface water quality. In aquifer-surface water ecotones, geochemical gradients and microbial biofilms mediate transformations of water chemistry. Subsurface fauna (stygofauna) graze biofilms, alter interstitial pore size through their movement, and physically transport material through the groundwater environment. Further, changes in their populations provide signals of declining water quality. Better integrating groundwater ecology, biogeochemistry, and hydrogeology will significantly advance our understanding of subterranean ecosystems, especially in terms of bioremediation of contaminated groundwaters, maintenance or improvement of surface water quality in groundwater-dependent ecosystems, and improved protection of groundwater habitats during the extraction of natural resources. Overall, this will lead to a better understanding of the implications of groundwater hydrology and aquifer geology to distributions of subsurface fauna and microbiota, ecological processes such as carbon cycling, and sustainable groundwater management.

TI Response of nitrogen pollution in surface water to land use and
   social-economic factors in the Weihe River watershed, northwest China
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB Water pollution is affecting China's water resources and environmental sustainability. Specifically, nitrogen pollution has become highly problematic in water management. To identify nitrogen pollution and its sources in the Weihe River, northwest China, concentrations of different forms of nitrogen, and delta N-15 and delta O-18 compositions were analyzed. The mean nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), and nitrite nitrogen (NO2--N) concentrations were 4.70, 0.34 and 0.09 mg L-1, respectively, indicating that nitrate was the dominant form of nitrogen pollution. The middle and lower reaches of the Weihe River suffered more severe nitrogen pollution problems than the upper reaches. The stable isotope and Bayesian model revealed that manure, domestic sewage and industrial wastewater discharge constituted the main sources of NO3--N pollution, with the contribution of 71.3% of the three sources. The redundancy analysis (RDA) showed a positive correlation between population, industrial wastewater, domestic sewage, livestock and nitrogen pollution concentrations. Forestlands and grasslands had negative effects on surface water nitrogen concentrations, with a total reduction effect of 55.8%. To improve the surface water quality in the Weihe River, it is recommended to increase sewage treatment, improve livestock manure utilization and refine the land-use structure of the watershed.

TI Spreadsheet tools for developing surface water supplies for freshwater
   fish production in developing countries
SO AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING
AB Variable rainfall distribution and terrain make surface water harvesting and storage a challenge in many developing countries. The overall goal of this study is to collect and develop information required to equip extension, non-governmental organization (NGO) agents,contractors and engineers for surface water development and aquaculture enterprise development in Honduras and Latin America. A pond water balance for the levee production pond enabling determination of water flow required to balance seepage, evaporation and direct rainfall was developed in English and Spanish on the Microsoft Excel(R) platform. The pump-in flow rate can also be determined for reaching a volume change per month target. A second model was formulated for evaluating surface water capture by watershed and/or hillside ponds for meeting the levee pond demand. Using hillside ponds that fill by impounding a fraction of total runoff (e.g., diverting water upstream) from streams appears to have promise for meeting water needs. A systematic approach using both models to reach a sustainable water supply target emerged from this work. Both the levee pond model and the water harvest model are based on balancing inputs and outputs given monthly rainfall patterns. A simple approach to mechanical spillways preliminary design was developed. The models are adaptable to any location if key input data is available, particularly average monthly rainfall and storm frequency-duration data. The models do not address water quality issues. The software is intended for watershed sizes not larger than 500 ha and storage ponds of less than 5 ha surface area-4 m depth due to relationship limitations and safety concerns. Coupling with other cooperative development concerns such as marketing association provides a platform for helping groups of people in a watershed to realize further the potential of enlightened self-interest in developing common solutions to water problems.

TI Upscaling of Surface Water and Groundwater Interactions in Hyporheic
   Zone from Local to Regional Scale
SO WATER
AB The groundwater (GW) and surface water (SW) interaction (SW-GW) through the hyporheic zone is a significant component in sustainable water resource management. The complexities in SW-GW interactions increase from a local to a regional scale and are affected by variation in hydraulic, hydrologic, and hydrogeologic (3H) processes. Controlling factors and their upscaling of these processes to assess SW-GW interaction have not been addressed sufficiently in previous studies. Additionally, it is unclear what the effective factors are at different scales during the upscaling. Therefore, the present review focused on controlling factors of 3H processes in SW-GW interaction and their upscaling techniques. Relevancy of controlling factors was identified at different scales. Applications of different approaches and their uncertainties were also discussed for the characterization of SW-GW interactions. The study revealed that the improved data from different approaches is crucial for machine learning training and its application in the SW and GW assessment at local, sub-catchment, and catchment scales. Based on the outcomes, a framework has been proposed to execute modalities of controlling factors using remote sensing, geophysics, and artificial intelligence. The proposed framework could help in handling big data and accurate upscaling for water resource management.

TI Surface Water Storage in Rivers and Wetlands Derived from Satellite
   Observations: A Review of Current Advances and Future Opportunities for
   Hydrological Sciences
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Surface water storage (SWS), the amount of freshwater stored in rivers/wetlands/floodplains/lakes, and its variations are key components of the water cycle and land surface hydrology, with strong feedback and linkages with climate variability. They are also very important for water resources management. However, it is still very challenging to measure and to obtain accurate estimates of SWS variations for large river basins at adequate time/space sampling. Satellite observations offer great opportunities to measure SWS changes, and several methods have been developed combining multisource observations for different environments worldwide. With the upcoming launch in 2022 of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission, which will provide, for the first time, direct estimates of SWS variations with an unprecedented spatial resolution (~100 m), it is timely to summarize the recent advances in the estimates of SWS from satellite observations and how they contribute to a better understanding of large-scale hydrological processes. Here, we review the scientific literature and present major results regarding the dynamic of surface freshwater in large rivers, floodplains, and wetlands. We show how recent efforts have helped to characterize the variations in SWS change across large river basins, including during extreme climatic events, leading to an overall better understanding of the continental water cycle. In the context of SWOT and forthcoming SWS estimates at the global scale, we further discuss new opportunities for hydrological and multidisciplinary sciences. We recommend that, in the near future, SWS should be considered as an essential water variable to ensure its long-term monitoring.</p>

TI Derivation of water quality criteria for glyphosate and its formulations
   to protect aquatic life in China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Extensive use of the herbicide glyphosate leads to a high detection rate in the environment and potential risks to nontarget aquatic life. China ranks first globally in the production and consumption of glyphosate, but there are no glyphosate water quality criteria (WQCs) for protecting aquatic life. Here, data on the acute and chronic toxicity of glyphosate and glyphosate-based formulations (GBFs) to freshwater aquatic life were collected and screened. Significant differences in species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) and toxicity values for acute or chronic toxicity were found between glyphosate and GBFs. The hazardous concentrations for 5% of species (HC5) of glyphosate or GBFs between native and nonnative species were different, and native species were found to be more sensitive to the toxicity of glyphosate. The acute and chronic WQCs derived with the SSD method for glyphosate based on the toxicity data for native species in China were 3.35 and 0.26 mg/L, respectively, and those found for GBFs were 0.21 and 0.005 mg/L, respectively. The WQCs in this study were quite different from those estimated using similar statistical extrapolation methods in other countries, which reflects the differences in species sensitivity to glyphosate toxicity in different regions. The hazard quotients (HQs) were calculated based on the WQCs and concentrations of glyphosate in some surface waters in China and indicated that glyphosate exhibits medium or high hazard risk in some samples of Tai Lake, surface water in Guiyang, fishpond water in Chongqing, rural drinking water, and surface water and reservoir water in Henan Province. The WQCs of glyphosate and GBFs have scientific significance for the exposure and pollution control of herbicide formulations and the protection of aquatic life in China.

TI Occurrence, fate and removal of microplastics as heavy metal vector in
   natural wastewater treatment wetland system
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Microplastics pollution in aquatic ecosystems is of great concern; however, systemic investigations are still lacking in freshwater wetland systems used for wastewater treatment. The present study discusses such freshwater wetland system in Eastern India to understand its microplastics transport mechanism, heavy metals association and microplastics removal efficiency. Microplastics (63 mu m 5 mm) were heavily found in surface water and sediments of treatment ponds (7.87 to 20.39 items/L and 2124.84 to 6886.76 items/kg) and associated wastewater canals (30.46 to 137.72 items/L and 1108.78 to 34612.87 items/kg). A high content of toxic metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) were found on the microplastics with polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene as major plastics types which were also found in fishes and macroinvertebrates of treatment ponds. Machine learning algorithm revealed a close association between microplastics content in fishes and surface water, indicating risk associated with floating microplastics to the aquatic biota. The study also revealed that microplastics were acting as heavy metals vector and potentially causing fish contamination. Surface water microplastics removing efficiency of the treatment ponds was estimated to be 53%. The study bespeaks about transport of microplastics through wastewater canals and their retention in treatment ponds emphasizing sustainability maintenance of natural wastewater treatment systems especially considering microplastics contamination to the aquatic biota of freshwater wetland systems.

TI Air-sea exchange of gaseous mercury in the tropical coast (Luhuitou
   fringing reef) of the South China Sea, the Hainan Island, China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The air-sea exchange of gaseous mercury (mainly Hg(0)) in the tropical ocean is an important part of the global Hg biogeochemical cycle, but the related investigations are limited. In this study, we simultaneously measured Hg(0) concentrations in surface waters and overlaying air in the tropical coast (Luhuitou fringing reef) of the South China Sea (SCS), Hainan Island, China, for 13 days on January-February 2015. The purpose of this study was to explore the temporal variation of Hg(0) concentrations in air and surface waters, estimate the air-sea Hg(0) flux, and reveal their influencing factors in the tropical coastal environment. The mean concentrations (+/- SD) of Hg(0) in air and total Hg (THg) in waters were 2.34 +/- 0.26 ng m(-3) and 1.40 +/- 0.48 ng L-1, respectively. Both Hg(0) concentrations in waters (53.7 +/- 18.8 pg L-1) and Hg(0)/THg ratios (3.8 %) in this study were significantly higher than those of the open water of the SCS in winter. Hg(0) in waters usually exhibited a clear diurnal variation with increased concentrations in daytime and decreased concentrations in nighttime, especially in cloudless days with low wind speed. Linear regression analysis suggested that Hg(0) concentrations in waters were positively and significantly correlated to the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (R (2) = 0.42, p < 0.001). Surface waters were always supersaturated with Hg(0) compared to air (the degree of saturation, 2.46 to 13.87), indicating that the surface water was one of the atmospheric Hg(0) sources. The air-sea Hg(0) fluxes were estimated to be 1.73 +/- 1.25 ng m(-2) h(-1) with a large range between 0.01 and 6.06 ng m(-2) h(-1). The high variation of Hg(0) fluxes was mainly attributed to the greatly temporal variation of wind speed.

TI Spread of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium ST133 in the aquatic
   environment in Switzerland
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE
AB Objectives: The global dissemination of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) has become a serious public-health concern. Although outbreaks are typically caused by nosocomial transmission, contaminated food and water may contribute to the spread of VRE. The aim of this study was to assess the presence of VRE in flowing surface water bodies in Switzerland and to characterise the isolates. Methods: Surface water was sampled from rivers, streams and canals throughout Switzerland and was screened for the presence of VRE. Whole-genome sequencing was used to identify antimicrobial resistance genes and the phylogenetic similarity of the obtained isolates. Results: VRE were detected in 6 (3.1%) of 191 water samples. The six VRE-containing samples were all collected near treated wastewater discharge sites. The six isolates were identified as Enterococcus faecium sequence type 133 (ST133) and harboured the vancomycin resistance-conferring vanA gene cluster on transposon Tn 1546 . They showed a close phylogenetic relationship to ST133 swine faecal isolates obtained during a previously reported screening in Switzerland. Conclusion: Our results suggest that surface water contributes to the environmental dissemination of VRE. Repeated identification of ST133 clones in geographically distinct water sampling sites and swine faecal samples collected in slaughterhouses may indicate a local dominance of this VRE lineage in Switzerland.

TI Crop insurance premium subsidy and irrigation water withdrawals in the
   western United States
SO GENEVA PAPERS ON RISK AND INSURANCE-ISSUES AND PRACTICE
AB We estimate the effects of the federal crop insurance premium subsidy on freshwater withdrawals for irrigation among U.S. counties to the west of the 100th meridian. Our results indicate that a 1% increase in premium subsidy leads to a 0.446% (about 475,901 acre-feet/year) and 0.673% (about 474,026 acre-feet/year) increase in total freshwater withdrawals for irrigation and fresh surface water withdrawals for irrigation, respectively. The elasticity of total freshwater withdrawals for irrigation and fresh surface water withdrawals for irrigation with respect to revenue insurance premium subsidy is more than twice as large as those with respect to yield insurance premium subsidy. Groundwater withdrawals for irrigation are not found to be responsive to crop insurance premium subsidy. Because the elasticities are all non-negative, moral hazard should not be a dominant factor in the relationship between crop insurance subsidies and freshwater withdrawals for irrigation. Thus, exploring the causal relationship between crop insurance premium subsidy and agricultural input uses, this study underscores the unintended effect of the federal crop insurance programme on water resource sustainability in the U.S.

TI Measuring Dynamic Changes in the Spatial Pattern and Connectivity of
   Surface Waters Based on Landscape and Graph Metrics: A Case Study of
   Henan Province in Central China
SO LAND
AB An understanding of the scientific layout of surface water space is crucial for the sustainable development of human society and the ecological environment. The objective of this study was to use land-use/land-cover data to identify the spatiotemporal dynamic change processes and the influencing factors over the past three decades in Henan Province, central China. Multidisciplinary theories (landscape ecology and graph theory) and methods (GIS spatial analysis and SPSS correlation analysis) were used to quantify the dynamic changes in surface water pattern and connectivity. Our results revealed that the water area decreased significantly during the periods of 1990-2000 and 2010-2018 due to a decrease in tidal flats and linear waters, but increased significantly in 2000-2010 due to an increase in patchy waters. Human construction activities, socioeconomic development and topography were the key factors driving the dynamics of water pattern and connectivity. The use of graph metrics (node degree, betweenness centrality, and delta probability of connectivity) in combination with landscape metrics (Euclidean nearest-neighbor distance) can help establish the parameters of threshold distance between connected habitats, identify hubs and stepping stones, and determine the relatively important water patches that require priority protection or development.

TI How anthropogenic factors influence the dissolved oxygen in surface
   water over three decades in eastern China?
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The aquatic environment, linked to the sustainable development of human existence and ecological environment, is influenced comprehensively by anthropogenic and natural activities. In light of the continuously low con-centration of dissolved oxygen (DO) in surface water in plain river networks and the phenomenon of delay in the improvement of surface water quality, this research aims to introduce a method that may be utilized in iden-tifying the critical driving forces of DO in surface water and their lagging characteristics, which will contribute to the assessment and adjustment of water quality drivers and/or policies. The research analyzes a typical small watershed in a river network region of the Yangtze River Delta plain as the study area, collecting 35-year (1986-2020) data on several water quality parameters, decades of anthropogenic activities, and two natural factors. The time series methods of vector autoregressive model, Granger causality tests, forecast error variance decompositions, and impulse response functions (hereinafter referred to as VAR+), which are rarely applied in related research, were employed in this study and proved helpful for screening out pivotal drivers and capturing the lagging responses of DO level to driving forces at each lagged time. Results show that there exists a fluc-tuating drop in DO level in surface water from 1986 to 2008 and a steady climb from 2008 to 2020, with the lowest DO level being present in 2008. The impulsive perturbations of phosphate fertilizer consumption (PFC), motor vessel number, and precipitation minimally increase DO concentration, while the impulsive perturbation of gross domestic product (GDP) causes the sharpest drop in DO level. With these perturbations, the driving force of PFC persists for approximately seven years, and the driving forces of water temperature, permanent popu-lation, and GDP persist for only five years. Future research could be conducted with spatial hysteresis, selection of lag order and variable quantity within the model, as well as intermediate variables between drivers and DO level for exploring driving pathways and mechanisms.

TI How much artificial surface storage is acceptable in a river basin and
   where should it be located: A review
SO EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB A key question in sustainable development is how much alteration in natural systems, such as river basins, is acceptable? One of the ways by which humans alter a river basin is by building water storage infrastructure. While storage reservoirs deliver numerous benefits, they can also induce social and environmental costs by displacing people, fragmenting river networks and altering downstream flow regimes. In such a context, merely capping total water withdrawal from rivers for human consumption is not sufficient. River basin plans should also identify optimal (acceptable) limits to surface storage capacities, and optimal numbers, degrees of distribution and locations of storage infrastructure. It remains largely unclear, however, whether it is possible to define a hydrologically, ecologically and socially justified 'surface water storage boundary' for a river basin. An associated question is what would be the 'best' arrangement of this bounding storage capacity in the basins river network (in terms of numbers, sizes and locations of reservoirs) to maximize water storage benefits and minimize environmental and social costs. The main objective of this review is to examine contemporary knowledge on surface water storage development with a focus on tools and approaches that may help to answer the above questions of a 'surface water storage boundary' and its 'optimum arrangement' for a river basin. In order to achieve this objective, our review introduces two novel concepts: the 'storage scale' and the 'sustainable storage development framework.' The 'storage scale' has four elements - capacity, number, distribution and location - individual scales that help visualize a 'surface water storage boundary' and its 'optimum arrangement' for a typical river basin. The 'sustainable storage development framework' consists of three dimensions - economic benefits, ecosystems and society- and a set of indicators quantifying each dimension. This review shows that optimal levels of the elements of the 'storage scale' may be identified using the 'sustainable storage development framework'.

TI Coupled surface water-groundwater model and its application in the Arid
   Shiyang River basin, China
SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
AB The planning and management of water resources in the Shiyang River basin, China require a tool for assessing the impact of groundwater and stream use on water supply reliabilities and improving many environment-related problems Such as soil desertification induced by recent water-related human activities. A Coupled model, integrating rule-based lumped surface water model and distributed three-dimensional groundwater flow model, has been established to investigate surface water and groundwater management scenarios that may be designed to restore the deteriorated ecological environment of the downstream portion of the Shiyang River basin. More than 66% of the water level among 24 observation wells have simulation error less than 1.0 m. The overall trend of the temporal changes of simulated and observed surface runoff at the Caiqi gauging station remains almost the same. The calibration was considered satisfactory. Initial frameworks for water allocation, including agricultural water-saving projects, water diversion within the basin and inter-basin water transfer, reducing agricultural irrigation area and surface water use instead of groundwater exploitation at the downstream were figured out that would provide a rational use of water resources throughout the whole basin. Sixteen scenarios were modelled to find out the most appropriate management strategies. The results showed that in the two selected management options, the groundwater budget at the Minqin basin was about 1.4 x 10(8) m(3)/a and the ecological environment Would be improved significantly, but the deficit existed at the Wuwei basin and the number was about 0.8 x 10(8) m(3)/a. Water demand for domestic, industry and urban green area Would be met in the next 30 years, but the water shortage for meeting the demand of agricultural water use in the Shiyang River basin was about 2.2 x 108 m(3)/a. It is suggested that more inter-basin water transfer should be required to obtain sustainable water resource use in the Shiyang River basin. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Performance assessment of a single-layer moisture store-and-release
   cover system at a mine waste rock pile in a seasonally humid region
   (Nova Scotia, Canada)
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB Cover systems are commonly applied to mine waste rock piles (WRPs) to control acid mine drainage (AMD). Single-layer covers utilize the moisture "store-and-release" concept to first store and then release moisture back to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration. Although more commonly used in semi-arid and arid climates, store-and-release covers remain an attractive option in humid climates due to the low cost and relative simplicity of installation. However, knowledge of their performance in these climates is limited. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of moisture store-and-release covers at full-scale WRPs located in humid climates. This cover type was installed at a WRP in Nova Scotia, Canada, alongside state-of-the-art monitoring instrumentation. Field monitoring was conducted over 5 years to assess key components such as meteorological conditions, cover material water dynamics, net percolation, surface runoff, pore-gas, environmental receptor water quality, landform stability and vegetation. Water balances indicate small reductions in water influx to the waste rock (i.e., 34 to 28% of precipitation) with the diminished AMD release also apparent by small improvements in groundwater quality (increase in pH, decrease in sulfate/metals). Surface water quality analysis and field observations of vegetative/aquatic life demonstrate significant improvements in the surface water receptor. The WRP landform is stable and the vegetative cover is thriving. This study has shown that while a simple store-and-release cover may not be a highly effective barrier to water infiltration in humid climates, it can be used to (i) eliminate contaminated surface water runoff, (ii) minimize AMD impacts to surface water receptor(s), (iii) maintain a stable landform, and (iv) provide a sustainable vegetative canopy.

TI Examining ground and surface water changes in response to environmental
   variables, land use dynamics, and socioeconomic changes in Canada
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Canada's abundant and high-quality water resources support a growing human population, as well as thriving industrial and agricultural economies. However, recent intense drought conditions have raised concerns for current water resource availability. Patterns of long-term ground and surface water (GSW) changes, and their response to environmental conditions, land-use dynamics, and socioeconomic changes are not well-understood across this large and diverse country. To address this crucial gap, we identified regions of ground and surface water (GSW) changes in all the Provinces of Canada between 2002 and 2016 from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) datasets. We explored the relationships between GSW changes and environmental, socioeconomic, and land-use dynamics over time. We found that all the Provinces of Canada gained a net 4.46 mm Liquid Water Equivalent (LWE) per year, equivalent to a total increase of 66.9 mm LWE. GSW increases were significantly associated with the normalized difference vegetation index and evapotranspiration rates. In contrast, GSW declines were significantly related to defores-tation rate, urban expansion, and economic development (median household income). Despite apparent wide-spread post-drought recovery detected from 2002 to 2016, the rapid GSW declines were also observed in almost all of Western Canada and part of Ontario, amounting to a net loss of 66.13 mm. This indicates that a pronounced drought had emerged. It is anticipated that Canada will be experiencing more frequent and severe droughts under ongoing climate change and increasing demand for water resources.

TI Environmental fluctuations in the northwestern Pacific Ocean during the
   last interglacial period: Evidence from radiolarian assemblages
SO MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY
AB The last interglacial period, from 130 to 117 ka, was as warm as or warmer than the present and thus it is relevant for our understanding of the possible effects of recent global warming. In this study, we used radiolarian assemblages in a sediment core to reconstruct environmental fluctuations in the northwestern Pacific Ocean during the last interglacial period. The sediment core (MD012421) was collected where the warm Kuroshio Current meets the cold Oyashio Current. We used the ratio of warm-water to the total of warm- and cool-water radiolarian species (Tr) as an indicator of the dominant surface water masses (relative importance of the warm Kuroshio and cool Oyashio Currents), and we used the relative abundance of Cycladophora davisiana as an indicator of cold, oxygen-rich intermediate waters related to seasonal sea ice formation at high latitudes. Tr results indicated that a transitional surface water mass off Kashima was replaced by a subtropical water mass between 131 ka (late Marine Isotope Stage [MIS] 6) and 125 ka (last interglacial period; MIS 5e). Furthermore, the relative abundance of C davisiana changed from 19.6% at 133 ka (late MIS 6) to similar to 0% at 126 ka (MIS 5e); this change suggests a reduction of cold, oxygen-rich waters at intermediate depths off Kashima in association with weakened ventilation at high latitudes in the North Pacific. As this reduction took place similar to 1 kyr earlier than the shift of surface water masses at the core site, we inferred that changes of insolation (the main driver of glacial-interglacial cycles) controlling the variation of sea ice formation at high latitudes occurred earlier than the lower latitude change in the atmospheric pressure pattern controlling the surface water shifts. High resolution time-series analysis indicated that fluctuations in the surface water mass occurred cyclically, with a periodicity of approximately 500 years during the second half of the last interglacial period. This periodicity may be attributable to fluctuations in solar radiation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of downstream environmental flow release on enhancing the
   groundwater recharge and restoring the groundwater/surface-water
   connectivity in Yongding River, Beijing, China
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB The Yongding River (Beijing, China) was dry most times of the year, and groundwater storage was severely depleted. To address this issue, a river rehabilitation project was initiated. A downstream environmental flow release (EFR) project from upstream reservoirs has been implemented since 2019. This study evaluated the impact of EFR by constructing transient groundwater-flow and numerical tracer transport models to simulate the hydrogeological responses to the water release events in 2019-2020. The study identified two factors that significantly influence the river leakage rate, which are operational factors (i.e., water release rate and duration) and physical factors (i.e., hydraulic properties of the riverbed, regional hydraulic gradients, and groundwater depth) that determine the maximum water availability for groundwater recharge and maximum infiltration capacity, respectively. Predictive modelling was performed to assess the long-term effects of the proposed EFR scheme from 2021 to 2050, which showed that groundwater levels along the river will increase by 10-20 m by 2050. Groundwater storage is expected to be largely recovered and groundwater/surface-water connectivity in the middle reach of the river will be restored. This restoration will not only maintain the environmental flow for the benefit of ecosystems but also enhance groundwater recharge, promoting sustainable groundwater development in the region. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of the proposed EFR scheme in achieving sustainable groundwater development in the region.

TI Isotopic fractionation of carbon during uptake by phytoplankton across
   the South Atlantic subtropical convergence
SO BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB The stable isotopic composition of particulate organic carbon (delta C-13(POC)) in the surface waters of the global ocean can vary with the aqueous CO2 concentration ([CO2(aq)]) and affects the trophic transfer of carbon isotopes in the marine food web. Other factors such as cell size, growth rate and carbon concentrating mechanisms decouple this observed correlation. Here, the variability in delta C-13(POC) is investigated in surface waters across the south subtropical convergence (SSTC) in the Atlantic Ocean, to determine carbon isotope fractionation (epsilon(p)) by phytoplankton and the contrasting mechanisms of carbon uptake in the subantarctic and subtropical water masses. Our results indicate that cell size is the primary determinant of delta C-13(POC) across the Atlantic SSTC in summer. Combining cell size estimates with CO2 concentrations, we can accurately estimate epsilon(p) within the varying surface water masses in this region. We further utilize these results to investigate future changes in epsilon(p) with increased anthropogenic carbon availability. Our results suggest that smaller cells, which are prevalent in the subtropical ocean, will respond less to increased [CO2(aq)] than the larger cells found south of the SSTC and in the wider Southern Ocean. In the subantarctic water masses, isotopic fractionation during carbon uptake will likely increase, both with increasing CO2 availability to the cell, but also if increased stratification leads to decreases in average community cell size. Coupled with decreasing delta C-13 of [CO2(aq)] due to anthropogenic CO2 emissions, this change in isotopic fractionation and lowering of delta C-13(POC) may propagate through the marine food web, with implications for the use of delta C-13(POC) as a tracer of dietary sources in the marine environment.

TI Groundwater Buffers Decreasing Glacier Melt in an Andean Watershed-But
   Not Forever
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Accelerating mountain glacier recession in a warming climate threatens the sustainability of mountain water resources. The extent to which groundwater will provide resilience to these water resources is unknown, in part due to a lack of data and poorly understood interactions between groundwater and surface water. Here we address this knowledge gap by linking climate, glaciers, surface water, and groundwater into an integrated model of the Shullcas Watershed, Peru, in the tropical Andes, the region experiencing the most rapid mountain-glacier retreat on Earth. For a range of climate scenarios, our model projects that glaciers will disappear by 2100. The loss of glacial meltwater will be buffered by relatively consistent groundwater discharge, which only receives minor recharge (similar to 2%) from glacier melt. However, increasing temperature and associated evapotranspiration, alongside potential decreases in precipitation, will decrease groundwater recharge and streamflow, particularly for the RCP 8.5 emission scenario.

TI Hyporheic invertebrates as bioindicators of ecological health in
   temporary rivers: A meta-analysis
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB Worldwide, many rivers cease flow and dry either naturally or owing to human activities such as water extraction. However, even when surface water is absent, diverse assemblages of aquatic invertebrates inhabit the saturated sediments below the river bed (hyporheic zone). In the absence of surface water or flow, biota of this zone may be sampled as an alternative to surface water-based ecological assessments. The potential of hyporheic invertebrates as ecological indicators of river health, however, is largely unexplored. We analysed hyporheic taxa lists from the international literature on temporary rivers to assess compositional similarity among broad-scale regions and sampling conditions, including the presence or absence of surface waters and flow, and the regional effect of hydrological phase (dry channel, non-flowing waters, surface flow) on richness. We hypothesised that if consistent patterns were found, then effects of human disturbances in temporary rivers may be assessable using hyporheic bioindicators. Assemblages differed geographically and by climate, but hydrological phase did not have a strong effect at the global scale. However, hyporheic assemblage composition within regions varied along a gradient of higher richness during wetter phases. This indicates that within geographic regions, hyporheic responses to surface drying are predictable and, by extension, hyporheic invertebrates are potentially useful ecological indicators of temporary river health. With many rivers now experiencing, or predicted to experience, lower flows and longer dry phases owing to climate change, the development of ecological assessment methods specific to flow intermittency is a priority. We advocate expanded monitoring of hyporheic zones in temporary rivers and recommend hyporheic invertebrates as potential bioindicators to complement surface water assessments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Investigation of Long-Term Roving Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining
   Activities Using Time-Series Sentinel-1 and Global Surface Water
   Datasets
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is a significant source of gold production globally despite the sector being informal and illegal. The rapid increase in the number of roving mining camps has negatively impacted the surrounding environment; however, the formation and transformation of roving mining camps have not been well studied. This study investigated the long-term trends and significant hotspots of roving camp-type ASGM (R-C-ASGM) in Katingain Regency, Central Kalimantan Province, Indonesia, from 1988 to 2020 using remotely sensed data, including Sentinel-1 time-series, global surface water (GSW), and world landcover datasets. Results show that several active R-C-ASGM sites existed in the Galangan and Kalanaman areas in 2017/2018. According to the GSW dataset, the Galangan area was estimated to be formed earlier, whereas the Kalanaman areas were recently formed and were associated with the Kalanaman river expansion. Notably, the center of Galangan was still a significant R-C-ASGM hotspot. The findings of this study broaden our understanding of R-C-ASGM transformation and identify significant R-C-ASGM hotspots over a long period. This study contributes to the development of timely and appropriate interventions for strengthening environmental governance.

TI Environmental impact of mining activities on the surface water quality
   in Tibet: Gyama valley
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Nearly 20 years of industrial scale metal mining operations in Tibet have caused an impact on the region's surface water quality. However, no information with respect to the pollution has been provided to the public. The aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical quality of the stream water and to assess the present and future potential risks of acid mine drainage to the regional and downstream environments.
   This study, based on data collected in 2006, 2007 and 2008 in the Gyama valley, using the Environmental Risk Index (I-ER) documents that elevated concentrations of Cu, Pb, Zn, Mn, Fe and Al in the surface water and streambed at the upper/middle part of the valley pose a considerably high risk to the local environment. In contrast, the risk level at the stream source area is zero and only minor risk at the lower reaches. The iron and copper contamination of the upper/middle part of the river appears to be both natural and accelerated by the mining activities. The level of dissolved contaminants in the water decreases within short distance downstream due to precipitation and sorption to the streambed and strong dilution by a tributary stream and eventually by the Lhasa River.
   A high content of heavy metals in the stream sediments as well as in a number of tailings with gangue and material from the ore processing, poses a great potential threat to the downstream water users. Environmental changes such as global warming or increased mining activity may increase the mobility of these pools of heavy metals. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A physically based model of global freshwater surface temperature
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB Temperature determines a range of physical properties of water and exerts a strong control on surface water biogeochemistry. Thus, in freshwater ecosystems the thermal regime directly affects the geographical distribution of aquatic species through their growth and metabolism and indirectly through their tolerance to parasites and diseases. Models used to predict surface water temperature range between physically based deterministic models and statistical approaches. Here we present the initial results of a physically based deterministic model of global freshwater surface temperature. The model adds a surface water energy balance to river discharge modeled by the global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB. In addition to advection of energy from direct precipitation, runoff, and lateral exchange along the drainage network, energy is exchanged between the water body and the atmosphere by shortwave and longwave radiation and sensible and latent heat fluxes. Also included are ice formation and its effect on heat storage and river hydraulics. We use the coupled surface water and energy balance model to simulate global freshwater surface temperature at daily time steps with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees on a regular grid for the period 1976-2000. We opt to parameterize the model with globally available data and apply it without calibration in order to preserve its physical basis with the outlook of evaluating the effects of atmospheric warming on freshwater surface temperature. We validate our simulation results with daily temperature data from rivers and lakes (U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), limited to the USA) and compare mean monthly temperatures with those recorded in the Global Environment Monitoring System (GEMS) data set. Results show that the model is able to capture the mean monthly surface temperature for the majority of the GEMS stations, while the interannual variability as derived from the USGS and NOAA data was captured reasonably well. Results are poorest for the Arctic rivers because the timing of ice breakup is predicted too late in the year due to the lack of including a mechanical breakup mechanism. Moreover, surface water temperatures for tropical rivers were overestimated, most likely due to an overestimation of rainfall temperature and incoming shortwave radiation. The spatiotemporal variation of water temperature reveals large temperature differences between water and atmosphere for the higher latitudes, while considerable lateral transport of heat can be observed for rivers crossing hydroclimatic zones, such as the Nile, the Mississippi, and the large rivers flowing to the Arctic. Overall, our model results show promise for future projection of global surface freshwater temperature under global change.

TI Ecotoxicological aspects related to the occurrence of emerging
   contaminants in the Dinaric karst aquifer of Jadro and Zrnovnica springs
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Karst aquifers are globally important source of drinking water and harbor specific ecosystems that are vulnerable to anthropogenic contamination. This paper provides insights into the occurrence and ecotoxicological characterization of 21 emerging contaminants (ECs) detected in the karst catchment of Jadro and Zrnovnica springs (Dinarides, Croatia). Karst springs used for water supply, surface water, and groundwater were sampled during seven campaigns. The ECs concentration levels ranged from 0.3 ng/L (tramadol in Jadro spring) to 372 ng/L (1H-benzotriazole in Cetina River). DEET was the most frequently detected ECs with an average concentration of around 50 ng/L in both surface water and groundwater. To prioritise detected ECs, their persistence (P), bioaccumulation (B), mobility (M) and toxicity (T) were assessed based on in silico strategy for PBT assessment and recently developed REACH PMT guidelines. PBT scores ranging below the threshold of 0.5, indicated non-PBT compounds of expected low concern. However, only 4 out of 21 detected ECs were not assessed as PMT/vPvM. Concerningly, 20 ECs were categorised as very mobile. Karst springs exhibited larger proportions of ECs meeting PMT/vPvM criteria than surface water. To characterise the contamination extent and estimate the incidence of adverse effects of detected ECs, a preliminary environmental risk assessment (ERA) was conducted. Most ECs posed no environmental risk with RQ values predominantly below 0.01. The total risk quotient RQsite accentuated Cetina River as having the highest risk compared to other sampling sites. This is the first study on ECs in Croatian karst, contributing to a growing need to understand the impacts of emerging contaminants in karst aquifers, which are still largely unexplored.

TI Oxidative stress in deep scattering layers: Heat shock response and
   antioxidant enzymes activities of myctophid fishes thriving in oxygen
   minimum zones
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
AB Diel vertical migrators, such as myctophid fishes, are known to encounter oxygen minimum zones (OMZ) during daytime in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and, therefore, have to cope with temperature and oxidative stress that arise while ascending to warmer, normoxic surface waters at night-time. The aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant defense strategies and heat shock response (HSR) in two myctophid species, namely Triphoturus mexicanus and Benthosema panamense, at shallow and warm surface waters (21 kPa, 20-25 degrees C) and at hypoxic, cold (<= 1 kPa, 10 degrees C) mesopelagic depths. More specifically, we quantified (i) heat shock protein concentrations (HSP70/HSC70) (ii) antioxidant enzyme activities [including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST)], and (iii) lipid peroxidation [malondialdehyde (MDA) levels]. HSP70/HSC70 levels increased in both myctophid species at warmer, well-oxygenated surface waters probably to prevent cellular damage (oxidative stress) due to increased oxygen demand under elevated temperatures and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. On the other hand, CAT and GST activities were augmented under hypoxic conditions, probably as preparatory response to a burst of oxyradicals during the reoxygenation phase (while ascending). SOD activity decreased under hypoxia in B. panamense, but was kept unchanged in T. mexicanus. MDA levels in B. panamense did not change between the surface and deep-sea conditions, whereas T. mexicanus showed elevated MDA and HSP70/HSC70 concentrations at warmer surface waters. This indicated that T. mexicanus seems to be not so well tuned to temperature and oxidative stress associated to diel vertical migrations. The understanding of such physiological strategies that are linked to oxygen deprivation and reoxygenation phases may provide valuable information about how different species might respond to the impacts of environmental stressors (e.g. expanding mesopelagic hypoxia) coupled with global climate change.

TI Contamination, bioaccumulation and toxic effects of perfluorinated
   chemicals (PFCs) in the water environment: a review paper
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Perfluorinated compounds such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctane acid (PFOA) have been recognized as emerging environmental pollutants because of their ubiquitous occurrence in the environment, biota and humans. The paper focuses on the distribution, bioaccumulation and toxic effects of PFOS and PFOA in the water. From the available literature, tap and surface water samples in several countries were found to be contaminated with PFOS and PFOA. These compounds were detected globally in the tissues of fish, bird and marine mammals. Their concentrations from relatively more industrialized areas were greater than those from the less populated and remote locations. Blood samples of occupationally exposed people and the general population in various countries were found to contain PFOS and PFOA which suggested a possibility of atmospheric transport of these compounds. There is still a death of information about the environmental pathways of PFOS and PFOA. The presence of these compounds in the tap water, surface water and animal and human tissues indicates their global contamination and bioaccumulative phenomena in the ecosystems.

TI Dataset on hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater and surface
   water in Kattumannarkoil Taluk, India
SO DATA IN BRIEF
AB Surfacewater overlay groundwater at the groundwater/surface water interface(GSI). Water and chemicals are continually exchanged via GSI. Surface water recharges the underlying aquifer and undergo significant changes in chemical composition before it discharges back into the stream or at the surface. Thus a sustainable management of water resource needs an insight in the water chemistry and seasonal variations. The hydrochemical dataset representing a total of 37 groundwater samples and 13 surface water samples has been collected from Kattumannarkoil taluk,India to identify the factors governing water chemistry of the region. Hence, the samples were collected during two different seasons summer (April 2015) and monsoon (September 2015) to broadly cover seasonal variation. The collected samples were analyzed for physical and chemical parameters. The physical parameters measured in the field are pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS). The chemical parameters analyzed in the laboratory are calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), nitrate (NO3-), phosphate (PO4), sulfate (SO42+) and silica (H4SiO4). Furthermore, the results were processed using AquaChem software, Geographical information system (GIS), multivariate statistical techniques and a computer program WATCLAST written in C++. This hydrochemical dataset ascertain the utility purpose of water. The dataset can serve as a guide for hydrogeochemistry of other predominantly agricultural area that share similar geological characteristics.

TI Environmental risk assessment of diclofenac residues in surface waters
   and wastewater: a hidden global threat to aquatic ecosystem
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB Pharmaceuticals are chemical compounds employed as medicinal drugs. They have severe physic-chemical properties which make them destructive for non-target species. Consequently, their continuous addition in the environment may pose hazardous effects. Among these, diclofenac (DCF), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is extensively used in Pakistan which may lead to its accumulation in both terrestrial and aquatic environment. Present study aims to assess the presence and concentration of pharmaceutically active drug (DCF) in surface water and wastewater of twin cities of Pakistan (Rawalpindi and Islamabad). For this purpose, a validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was adopted involving solid-phase extraction procedure. Wastewater samples were collected from various sites of Rawalpindi and Islamabad. Results of HPLC analysis revealed that DCF was extant with considerably high concentration, not only in wastewater but also in surface water samples. Concentrations as high as 216 mu g L-1 was detected in Rawat industrial area and low as 8 mu g L-1 was detected in dairy farm wastewater samples collected from Taramri. However, maximum DCF levels in residential wastewater and hospital wastewater were detected to be 105 mu g L-1 and 34 mu g L-1, respectively. Moreover, the highest detected level (116 mu g L-1) was found in surface water of Sawan River. Further, results of ecological risk assessment revealed its possible toxic effects of DCF on various aquatic organisms.

TI Using multiple environmental methods to estimate groundwater discharge
   into an arid lake (Dakebo Lake, Inner Mongolia, China)
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB It is important to have both a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the hydraulic exchange between groundwater and surface water to support the development of effective management plans for sustainable use of water resources. Groundwater is a major source of surface-water recharge and plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of ecosystems, especially within wetlands in semi-arid regions. The Ordos Desert Plateau of Inner Mongolia (China) is a vulnerable ecosystem that suffers from an extreme lack of water. The hydraulic exchange between groundwater and lake water in Dakebo Lake (the largest of hundreds of lakes on the Ordos Desert Plateau) was evaluated using multiple environmental methods. Continuous monitoring of the groundwater and lake-water levels indicated that the lake was recharged vertically by groundwater. Application of hydrodynamic and temperature tracing methods to the western side of the lake indicated that the rate of groundwater discharge to the lake was about 2 x 10(-6) to 3 x 10(-6) m/s in spring, summer, and autumn, but that there was no recharge in winter because the hypolentic zone (HZ) was frozen. Mixing ratios of groundwater and lake water in the HZ, estimated from the O-18 and H-2 ratios, showed that there were spatial variations in the hydrodynamic exchange between groundwater and lake water within the HZ.

TI Pollution Characteristics and Health Exposure Risks of Heavy Metals in
   River Water Affected by Human Activities
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Under the influence of human activities, surface water quality has been significantly affected, which threatens human health and sustainability. In order to clarify the potential risks of heavy metal pollution to human health in river water, two tributaries of the Tumen River with significant differences in human activity interference were selected for investigation. Comparative analysis of the contents of chromium (Cr), cuprum (Cu), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and plumbum (Pb) in the surface water of the two tributaries showed that the concentrations of As and Hg in some sampling sites exceeded the pollution standard values, and the Buerhatong River had a higher pollution level. Further analysis of the health risks revealed that the hazard quotient values of Cr, Cu, As, Cd, Hg, and Pb were <1, but the cumulative risk value of the Buerhatong River was higher than 1 for children, indicating adverse effects on human health. The As levels under the fish ingestion scenario had unacceptable carcinogenic risks, while the Cr in the Buerhatong River for adults and Cr and Pb in the Buerhatong River and Hunchun River for children had acceptable carcinogenic risks. Moreover, the As in the incidental water ingestion scenario also had acceptable carcinogenic risks. Therefore, the increase in human activity intensity can promote the increase in the health exposure risk of heavy metals in river water, and fish ingestion was the main exposure pathway, while children had higher exposure risks than adults.

TI Quantifying Groundwater's Contribution to Regional Environmental-Flows
   in Diverse Hydrologic Landscapes
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB Increasing recognition of the importance of ecosystem services in water resources management has accelerated the development and application of environmental-flows requirements for lotic ecosystems. However, most environmental-flows management focuses on water infrastructure, such as dams or diversions, without explicitly taking groundwater into account and ignoring the importance of groundwater environmental flow contribution. In this study two methods for estimating groundwater environmental flow contributions are presented: (a) a groundwater-centric method (based on the Sustainability Boundary Approach), which proposes that high levels of ecological protection are maintained if 90% of groundwater discharge is preserved, and (b) a surface water-centric method (novel method), which quantifies groundwater environmental flow contributions from streamflow using region-specific streamflow sensitivity metrics and local environmental-flows policies. The two methods were tested in British Columbia, Canada, which has a diverse, complex, and highly coupled groundwater-surface water system. The two methods gave comparable results in various hydro-geoclimatic settings. Although British Columbia was used as a case study, this framework can be implemented across various spatial and temporal scales for different regions and globally, in data-scarce, hydrologically complex landscapes. Application of these methods can aid in a robust and holistic assessment of environmental-flows, taking into account the often-missing groundwater component.

TI Psychrophilic versus psychrotolerant bacteria - Occurrence and
   significance in polar and temperate marine habitats
SO CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB The numerical dominance and ecological role of psychrophilic bacteria in bottom sediments, sea ice, surface water and melt pools of the polar oceans were investigated using isolates, colony forming units (CFU) and metabolic activities. All sediment samples of the Southern Ocean studied showed a clear numerical dominance of cold-loving bacteria. In Arctic sediments underlying the influence of cold polar water bodies psychrophiles prevailed also but they were less dominant in sediments influenced by the warm Atlantic Water. A predominance of psychrophiles was further found in consolidated Antarctic sea ice as well as in multiyear Arctic sea ice and in melt pools on top of Arctic ice floes. A less uniform adaptation response was, however, met in polar surface waters. In the very northern part of the Fram Strait (Arctic Ocean) we found bacterial counts and activities at 1 degreesC exceeding those at 22 degreesC. In surface water of the Weddell Sea (Southern Ocean) psychrophiles also dominated numerically in early autumn but the dominance declined obviously with the onset of winter-water and a decrease of chlorphyll a. Otherwise in surface water of the Southern Ocean CFUs were higher at 22 degreesC than at 1 degreesC while activities were vice versa indicating at least a functional dominance of psychrophiles. Even in the temperate sediments of the German Bight true psychrophiles were present and a clear shift towards cold adapted communities in winter observed. Among the polar bacteria a more pronounced cold adaptation of Antarctic in comparison with Arctic isolates was obtained. The results and literature data indicate that stenothermic cold adapted bacteria play a significant role in the global marine environment. On the basis of the temperature response of our isolates from different habitats it is suggested to expand the definition of Morita in order to meet the cold adaptation strategies of the bacteria in the various cold habitats.

TI Assessing water quality in the Dong Nai River (Vietnam): implications
   for sustainable management and pollution control
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The Dong Nai River provides essential water resources for millions of people across 11 provinces and cities in Vietnam. However, pollution from different sources such as household, farming, and industrial operations has caused the river's water quality to deteriorate over the past decade. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the river's surface water quality, this study employed the water quality index (WQI) across 12 different sampling sites. Results revealed a range of surface water quality, from poor to good according to the VN-WQI, and a medium level to even a bad level in some months according to the NS-WQI. The study also identified temperature, coliform, and dissolved oxygen (DO) as strong contributors to WQI values (according to the VN-WQI standard). Principal component analysis/factor analysis (PCA/FA) was used to determine pollution sources, with the results highlighting agricultural and domestic activities as the main contributors to river pollution. In conclusion, this study underscores the importance of effective planning and management of infrastructure zoning and local activities to improve the river's surface water quality and surrounding areas, as well as safeguard the well-being of the millions who depend on it.

TI Evaluation and Correlation Analysis of Surface Water In and Around
   Mangalore Coastal Belt, Karnataka, India
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION
AB Urbanisation, industrialisation, population growth and various agricultural activities in and around coastal areas have led to a significant amount of pollutants into the surrounding aquatic ecosystem such as estuary, river, sea, seashore and coastal wetlands. This causes ecological degradation. Pollution is one of the major challenges to the sustainability of coastal areas. In the study area, major industries are located on the Gurupur river bank which joins the Nethravati river to form a common estuary before entering the Arabian sea. The major activities that are responsible for coastal pollution in the study area are discharge and disposal of untreated domestic and industrial wastes to estuaries, rivers, nearshore waters and harbour activities. Gurupura and Nethravthi are two west flowing rivers of the Mangaluru coastal region. They receive a large amount of pollution load from the nearby industries causing the deterioration of the water quality. In this study, 10 surface water samples which include stream water, river water and sea water, were collected during the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon and analysed for various water quality parameters by adopting standard methods. The study reveals that the electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids and chlorides concentration of most of the surface water samples were met above the standard limits in both seasons. From the correlation analysis, it was found that a very strong correlation was observed between chlorides and hardness (0.9691), TDS and conductivity (0.9227) during post-monsoon season of 2018 and TDS and conductivity (1.00), COD and chlorides (0.8922), DO and chlorides (0.8810) during pre-monsoon of 2019.

TI Factors controlling the geographical distribution of fluorescent
   dissolved organic matter in the surface waters of the Pacific Ocean
SO LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the epipelagic ocean is produced by marine organisms and consumed by microbes. Thus, the distributional patterns of DOM quantity and quality in surface waters are possibly related to marine ecological provinces. In this study, surface waters collected throughout the Pacific Ocean were used to investigate the geographical distributions of fluorescent DOM (FDOM) quantity and quality. An excitation-emission matrix and parallel factor analysis revealed two humic-like and two protein-like components. The levels of humic-like components showed clear meridional trends with some zonal variability and were highest and lowest in the northern high-latitude and the subtropical provinces, respectively. The photochemical reactivity, determined by the ratio of two humic-like components, was found to be lowest in the subtropical provinces, implying that the major factor controlling the geographical distribution of humic-like components is the degree of photobleaching. The distributional patterns differed between levels of two protein-like components, i.e., tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like. The ratio of tyrosine-like to tryptophan-like components was established as a possible indicator of microbial degradability, and the highest ratio occurred in subtropical provinces. A negative correlation was found between this ratio and the chlorophyll a concentration. Such geographical distributions of protein-like components imply that relatively recalcitrant protein-like components are distributed uniformly throughout the surface waters, but substantial contributions of reactive fractions occur in regions characterized by high biological production. Cluster analysis with the FDOM composition clarified that the diagenetic states of DOM were similar and variable in the northern high-latitude and the subtropical provinces, respectively.

TI Climate change adaptation and mitigation measures for alluvial
   aquifers-Solution approaches based on the thermal exploitation of
   managed aquifer (MAR) and surface water recharge (MSWR)
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB As climate change adaptation strategies, both Managed Aquifer (MAR) and Surface Water Recharge (MSWR) are not only highly suitable tools to mitigate negative effects on water resources but also bear large potential for concomitant exploitation of thermal energy. They should thus form an integral part of any sustainable water resources management strategy. However, while at global scale general water resource adaptation and mitigation measures are discussed widely, measures that build on thermal exploitation of MAR and MSWR, and which are readily adaptable to various different local and regional scale conditions, have yet to be developed. Here, based on systematic numerical analyses of the sensitivity of groundwater and surface water recharge as well as water temperatures to climate change, we present adaptable implementation strategies of MAR and MSWR with concomitant exploitation of their thermal energy potential. Strategies and feasibility benchmarks for the exploitation of hydrologic and energetic potentials of MAR and MSWR were developed based on three hydrologically and hydrogeologically contrasting urban study sites near the city of Basel, Switzerland. Our studies show projected trends in the number of days when surface water temperatures exceed 25 degrees C examined for various streamflow and climate scenarios. We illustrate that local hydrogeologic settings and hydrological boundary conditions as well as legal aspects affect to which degree MAR and MSWR are suitable solutions as climate change adaptation measures. Optimal situations for exploiting the potential of seasonal heat storage in MAR and MSWR exist where subsurface travel times between the injection and the withdrawal or exfiltration point are between 4 and 8 months and legal limits allow a sufficiently large temperature spread. In such settings, the exploitable water flux and temperature spread of MAR and MSWR reaches a heat potential of 14 to 20 MW (i.e., corresponding to 3 to 7 wind power plants), and energetic exploitation becomes a suitable tool either for local low-temperature heat applications such as heating and hot water or for ecological use as a heat and water buffer in rivers affected by seasonal droughts. As a positive side effect, climate-induced warming of groundwater resources and temperature increases in drinking water withdrawals would be mitigated simultaneously.

TI Recent studies on surface water-groundwater relationships at
   hydro-projects in India using environmental isotopes
SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
AB Environmental isotopes ((2)H or D, (18)O, (3)H), along with geology, hydrochemistry and in situ physiochemical parameters (EC, T. DO, pH) were employed to study surface water (reservior, lake)-groundwater (spring) relationships at (1) Nagewadi, a minor irrigation project in the State of Maharashtra, Western India; (2) Kanhirapuzha reservoir in the State of Kerala, Southern India and (3) Ghatghar Pumped Storage Hydroelectric Project in the State of Maharashtra. Western India for the purpose of understanding the seepage/leakage and its associated problems. The studies concluded that the springs found downstream of the Nagewadi project originate from the reservoir and not from the abutments or shallow aquifers. The Kanhirapuzha reservoir receives a substantial base-flow component compared to riverine inputs. The reason for the water-logging problem at a nearby downstream village during the non-summer periods is due to the change in the upstream groundwater flow direction under reservior filling conditions and is not due to reservior leakage. Most of the springs in the approach tunnel to the underground power house of the Ghatghar Project originate from the lower reservior and not from the upper reservoir or the overburden rock matrix. The above case studies illustarte the diversity of environmental isotope applications in surface water (reservoir, lake)-groundwater (spring) relationship related to sustainability of hydro-projects.

TI Anthropogenic Signatures of Lead in the Northeast Atlantic
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Anthropogenic activities have resulted in enhanced lead (Pb) emissions to the environment over the past century, mainly through the combustion of leaded gasoline. Here we present the first combined dissolved (DPb), labile (LpPb), and particulate (PPb) Pb data set from the Northeast Atlantic (Celtic Sea) since the phasing out of leaded gasoline in Europe. Concentrations of DPb in surface waters have decreased by fourfold over the last four decades. We demonstrate that anthropogenic Pb is transported from the Mediterranean Sea over long distances (>2,500km). Benthic DPb fluxes exceeded the atmospheric Pb flux in the region, indicating the importance of sediments as a contemporary Pb source. A strong positive correlation between DPb, PPb, and LpPb indicates a dynamic equilibrium between the phases and the potential for particles to buffer the DPb pool. This study provides insights into Pb biogeochemical cycling and demonstrates the potential of Pb in constraining ocean circulation patterns.
   Plain Language Summary Lead (Pb) is a toxic element to all living organisms and may cause health impacts upon exposure to high levels. Humans have introduced large amounts of Pb into environment over last 150 similar to years mainly through combustion of leaded gasoline and coal. The anthropogenic Pb is transported over long distances in the atmosphere and deposited in remote ocean regions resulting in elevated Pb concentrations. Since the implementation of stricter environmental regulations over last decades, Pb levels in surface waters have declined. In this study we report five times lower Pb concentrations in European surface waters compared with those from the 1980s and also present recent Pb inputs. Once anthropogenic Pb is introduced into the marine environment, it can be used to trace specific water mass transport throughout the global ocean. In this study we use Pb signal to demonstrate transport of Mediterranean Sea surface water over 2,500 similar to km across the Atlantic Ocean. Our results serve as evidence of the positive impact of environmental regulations on Pb inputs and highlight the requirement of continuing efforts in regulating Pb emissions.

AB The Okavango Delta is a large alluvial fan complex in the northwest corner of Botswana. Both surface and groundwater in this area are important to wildlife, flora and human settlements. The study covered an area of over 14,000 km(2). The primary control on groundwater development potential is water quality, with much of the area characterised by brackish/saline aquifers. This largely reflects the high rate of potential evapotranspiration. As a consequence, freshwater aquifers are strongly dependent on recharge from surface water during flooding. The transition zone in shallow aquifers from fresh to brackish and saline conditions is abrupt. The transition is characterised by increasing levels of dissolved solids and migration of saline water from underlying aquifers. Lateral inflow from surrounding saline aquifers does not appear to be a significant. The impacts of evapotranspiration indicate the importance of regular surface water recharge to sustainable development of groundwater resources.

TI Low cost and sustainable surface water purification methods using
   Moringa seeds and scallop powder followed by bio-sand filtration
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY
AB A simple and inexpensive water purification method was developed using natural coagulant (Moringa seed powder) and antibacterial agents (scallop powder) followed by bio-sand filtration. In this study, surface water from different sources (e.g. pond, canal, lake and river) treated with combined Moringa seed powder, and scallop powder (MOSP) at a ratio of 2:1 for 10 minutes showed a clear water layer at the top and a sediment layer at the bottom. The clear water was then passed through an eight-fold sari cloth and/or natural bio-sand filtration and the resulting water was found drinkable. The microbiological and physico-chemical quality of this water showed non-significant differences compared to the US EPA drinking water quality parameters. Moreover, no cytotoxic effect of MOSP with BHK-21 and HeLa cells, nor any bacterial endotoxins were observed, indicating use of MOSP does not pose any adverse health effect. Furthermore, the quality of 6 months stored water at room temperature was found acceptable, indicating the usefulness of this technology for drinking water purposes. On the other hand, the sediment or sludge produced in this process could be used in agricultural fields after proper composting. Therefore, this simple, inexpensive and ecofriendly method could be used in drinking water scarcity areas of the world.

TI Toxicological Effects of Surface Water Exposed to Coal Contamination on
   the Test System Allium cepa
SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB Process related to power generation, i.e., extraction and burning of coal, strongly affects the soil, water resources, and air quality. Pollutants generated by the coal mining can lead to a number of environmental problems and has become matter of global concern. This study has focused on to evaluate the cytotoxicity and phytotoxicity of surface waters collected in the surroundings of the Thermoelectric Power Plant President M,dici-UTPM (Candiota, Brazil), through Allium cepa bioassay and physicochemical analyzes. Three water samples collected at points P1, P2, and P3 were compared to the negative control (NC) for all variables analyzed. The P2 sample resulted in the lowest mitotic index (MI) values (23, 33.1, and 40.7%), followed by P1 (23, 33.1, and 40.7%). However, the P3 sample had the highest MI values (50.2, 40.1, and 36.3%) and was the most mutagenic sample compared to NC and other treatments. Samples P1, P2, and P3 were phytotoxic to A. cepa, resulting in abnormal seedlings. Through physicochemical analysis, all collected water samples showed high electrical conductivity and turbidity, indicating an increase in the deposition of metallic ions and organic compounds in these samples. Based on these findings, we can conclude that the analysis of surface water is an important step for screening mining areas potentially contaminated by coal compounds. Therefore, our study points out some consequences of mining process, in terms of A. cepa bioassay as well as their harmful effect on physicochemical constituents of surface waters, indicating the need for environmental monitoring of this region.

TI Occurrence, distribution, and attenuation of pharmaceuticals and
   personal care products in the riverside groundwater of the Beiyun River
   of Beijing, China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB This study investigated the occurrence, seasonal-spatial distribution characteristics, and attenuation process of 15 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in riverside sections of Beiyun River of Beijing. The overall PPCP levels both in surface water and riverside groundwater were moderate on the global scale, and showed higher concentrations in the dry season mainly caused by water temperature variation. Caffeine (CF), carbamazepine (CBZ), metoprolol (MTP), N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), diclofenac (DF), bezafibrate (BF), and gemfibrozil (GF) were seven representative PPCPs, because the rest eight studied compounds occurred in low concentrations and less than 15% of the total concentration of PPCPs. Caffeine and bezafibrate, respectively, was the most abundant compound in surface water and riverside groundwater, with median concentrations of 3020.0 and 125.0 ng L-1. Total concentrations of PPCPs in surface water were much higher than those in the riverside groundwater spatially. Attenuation of PPCPs during riverbank filtration was largely depending on the sources, site hydrogeological conditions, and physical-chemical properties of PPCPs, also was influenced by dissolved organic matter and environmental physicochemical parameters. CF, MTP, DEET, and CBZ were potential groundwater attenuation contaminants; DF, BF, and GF were groundwater-enriched contaminants based on their removal rates. Predominant removal mechanism of PPCPs like CF was biodegradation. Attenuation simulation showed that the one-way supply between Beiyun River and riverside groundwater, and further confirmed Beiyun River, was the main source of pharmaceutical compounds in the riverside groundwater.

TI Satellite remote sensing of large lakes and reservoirs: from elevation
   and area to storage
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER
AB The majority of liquid surface freshwater globally is stored in large lakes and reservoirs. However, consistent observations of lakes and reservoirs are very limited, which makes it challenging to assess the surface water effect on global weather forecasting, earth system modeling, water management planning, and ecosystem sustainability. The advance of satellite remote sensing has offered a unique opportunity for monitoring large lakes and reservoirs from space. This article provides a comprehensive review of the satellite remote sensing approaches for estimating lake/reservoir elevations, areas, and storage variations. These include: (1) measuring surface water elevations using radar and laser altimeters; (2) estimating lake/reservoir areas using threshold-based and image classification-based approaches at visible and/or near infrared frequencies; and (3) combining elevation and area information to infer storage and storage variations. Different algorithms (as well as satellite sensors) applicable for these purposes are compared in terms of their advantages and limitations. Future direction and opportunities for more comprehensive data products with improved spatial and temporal resolutions are discussed. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Occurrence and ecological risk of pharmaceuticals in river surface water
   of Bangladesh
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Pharmaceutical contamination in the aquatic environment is a global issue that affects aquatic animals, microorganisms and human health. The occurrence and preliminary ecological risk of 12 (11 antibiotics and 1 antiepileptic drug) pharmaceuticals were investigated for the first time in the surface water of the old Brahmaputra River, where open-water-fed aquaculture activities are being practiced in Bangladesh. The pharmaceuticals were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), operated with positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) and a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Nine pharmaceuticals were detected in the river surface water, whereas three were below the limit of detection (LOD). Metronidazole was detected in all the samples with concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 13.51 ng L-1 Trimethoprim had the second highest frequency of detection (95%) with the highest concentration (17.20 ng L-1). The ranges of concentration and detection frequency of sulfonamides and macrolides were < LOD-11.35 and < LOD-16.68 ng L-1 ; 35-70 and 60-85%, respectively, whereas carbamazepine was in the range of < LOD-8.80 ng L-1 and had a detection frequency of 65%. The concentrations of sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, erythromycin-H2O and tylosin were distinctly higher in the fed aquaculture areas. The principal component analysis confirmed that fed aquaculture activities contributed most of the pharmaceutical contamination in the river surface water. Hospitals, nursing homes, sewage wastewater or surface runoff from the surrounding areas might all contribute to the presence of metronidazole and carbamazepine. The preliminary ecological risk assessment revealed that sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin-H2O and tylosin showed medium risk, and carbamazepine displayed low risk to sensitive aquatic organisms for maximum measured concentrations. Thus, this study suggests that pharmaceutical contamination in different rivers and seasons needs to be quantified, and ecological as well as human health risks need to be assessed in Bangladesh.

TI A Search for Freshwater in the Saline Aquifer of Coastal Bangladesh
SO GROUNDWATER
AB In the polder region of coastal Bangladesh, shallow groundwater is primarily brackish with unpredictable occurrence of freshwater pockets. Delta building processes, including the codeposition of fresh-to-saline porewater and sediments, have formed the shallow aquifer. Impermeable clay facies and the lack of a topographical gradient limit the flow of groundwater and its mixing with surface water so controls on spatial variability of salinity are not obvious. By characterizing groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interactions, this study attempted to identify areas of potable groundwater for the polder communities. We used transects of piezometers, cores, electromagnetic induction, and water chemistry surveys to explore two sources of potential fresh groundwater: (1) tidal channel-aquifer exchange and (2) meteoric recharge. Fresh groundwater proved difficult to find due to heterogeneous subsurface lithology, asymmetrical tidal dynamics, extreme seasonal fluctuations in rainfall, and limited field data. Geophysical observations suggest substantial lateral variability in shallow subsurface conductivity profiles. Piezometers show varying degrees of tidal pressure attenuation away from the channels. Nevertheless, the active exchange of freshwater appears to be limited due to low permeability of banks and surface sediments. Results indicate that pockets of fresh groundwater cannot be identified using readily available hydrogeological methods, so alternative drinking water sources should be pursued. By better understanding the hydrogeology of the system, however, communities will be better equipped to redirect water management resources to more feasible and sustainable drinking water options.

TI Making space for unruly water: Sustainable drainage systems and the
   disciplining of surface runoff
SO GEOFORUM
AB This paper explores the disciplining of non-human actors through the example of sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) managing surface water runoff. The lens of performativity is used to examine the move from pre-modern repressive forms of discipline, to mechanisms which attempt a more productive disciplinary engagement by finding space to reform water's more unruly behaviours. After examining the problems with traditional disciplinary approaches to water of rapid transit and exile, the paper explores the implications of a move towards SuDS technology. This change is examined using a case study of Glasgow, Scotland, where there is an attempt to utilise less repressive disciplinary mechanisms and to find spaces in the city for surface water outside the hard drainage infrastructure. New approaches to the disciplining of urban water are conceptualised as being a performance of tension between water and those who would modify its behaviour. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Hydrochemistry and stable isotope indication of natural mineral water in
   Changbai Mountain, China
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
AB Study region: Changbai Mountain area, China.
   Study focus: The characteristics and process of water-rock interactions of natural mineral water are revealed using hydrochemical and isotopic data.
   New hydrological insights: The results confirm rock weathering plays a leading role in the mechanism of chemical composition of mineral water, which is controlled by lithology and tectonic environment within the region. Mineral water chemistry is mainly controlled by dissolution/precipitation of feldspar, pyroxene and olivine. The hydrolysis of primary silicate minerals may provide solutes for CO2 and metasilicate. Deep underground circulation and shallow soil leaching promotes the formation compound mineral water. Affected by temperature and water vapor sources, slope of Local Meteoric Water Line is less than Global Meteoric Water Line. Compared with mineral water, surface water is more affected by evaporation and stable isotopes of it is more enrich. There is a certain delay in precipitation recharge according to isotope characteristics. The average recharge ratio of mineral water to surface water is 60%, which has a great impact on the amount of surface water resources. These results can provide a reference for the establishment of genetic model and sustainable utilization of natural mineral water with high ecological value.

TI Pesticide Contamination in Drinking and Surface Water in the Cienega,
   Jalisco, Mexico
SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB Sixty percent of global agricultural production depends on the use of pesticides, despite their adverse effects on human health and the ecosystem. In Mexico, the application of these products has been exacerbated, including pesticides already banned in other countries. The objective of this study was to determine pesticide concentrations in samples of water purification plants and surface water from the Cienega area of Jalisco, Mexico. A survey of 119 farmers with occupational exposure to pesticides was carried out in order to obtain information on the most frequently used pesticides. Subsequently, 51 samples taken at 7 different sites were analyzed using liquid chromatography and mass-mass spectrometry. The most frequently used pesticides were organophosphates (28.87%), pyrethroids (12.89%), and the herbicide paraquat (31.95%). In surface water, the prevalent pesticides were glyphosate (56.96-510.46 ppb) and malathion (311.76-863.49 ppb). Glyphosate levels were higher than the limits acceptable in daily water intake in Cumuato. Malathion levels exceeded the limits permissible by EPA in water purification plants in urban public establishments (100 ppb for children, and 200 ppb for adults). In addition, a multidimensional scaling analysis showed that the sampled sites could be grouped into 2 different bodies of water, based on similarities in their glyphosate concentrations (stress = 0.005), while the concentrations of malathion were heterogeneous (stress = 0.001).

TI Occurrence and risk assessment of heavy metals in urban water systems of
   Beijing, China
SO DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT
AB Heavy metals pollution in urban water systems is a common difficulty for global metropolises, in particular, in the developing Asian countries like China. Although heavy metals pollution in urban soils of Beijing has already been reported frequently, the study about heavy metals pollution in urban water systems is still rare. To evaluate the accumulation of heavy metals in urban water systems and assess the risk of heavy metals for the health of citizens, we conducted this study and examined the concentrations of some heavy metals including Cr, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn in surface water, groundwater, influents, and effluents of sewage treatment plants (STPs), and effluents of hospitals in Beijing. Concentrations of all the determined heavy metals were lower than the standard limits of China. The highest concentration was detected in the effluents of hospital with as high as 5-33 times in the surface water of the Wenyu River and ground water, and the concentration in the influents of STPs took the second highest place. From the perspective of spatial distribution, heavy metals pollution in the midstream and downstream of surface water (Wenyu River) was more serious than that in the upstream. In addition, the concentrations of heavy metals were not correlated with different depths in groundwater. The result of health risk assessment showed that carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks for drinking water were within the acceptable range. Our data demonstrated that women were more sensitive to the toxicity of heavy metals, especially, for Cr.

TI Development of a Dispersive Liquid-Liquid Microextraction Followed by
   LC-MS/MS for Determination of Benzotriazoles in Environmental Waters
SO ACTA CHIMICA SLOVENICA
AB Emerging environmental pollutants are becoming a global concern, since the acceptable concentrations are currently not set by legislation in EU or elsewhere. Benzotriazoles are an important group of emerging pollutants found in low p.g/L concentrations, entering the environment through wastewater treatment facilities due to their insufficient removal, and through industrial and other use. Two new dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) methods were developed for the extraction of hydrophilic and hydrophobic benzotriazoles from environmental waters. Liquid chromatographic method coupled to tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS) was developed and validated for surface water. Validation parameters were satisfactory and the overall DLLME-LC-MS/MS method was found to be applicable to analysis of the chosen analytes in environmental waters. It was used to determine benzotriazoles in surface water and wastewater from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. In surface waters, concentration was below the limit of detection, while concentrations determined in wastewater were estimated between 2.7 and 12.0 mu g/L.

TI Hydroecology of Argyroneta aquatica's Habitat in Hantangang River
   Geopark, South Korea
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The water spider (Argyroneta aquatic) is the only known spider to live a fully aquatic life. Therefore, it has been the subject of a series of studies on various aspects of its unique biology such as its reproductive behavior, sexual dimorphism, physiology, genetics, and silk. However, there have been relatively few studies on the hydroecology of where water spiders live. The water spider habitat in Eundae-ri, Yeoncheon is the only habitat for A. aquatica, a globally rare species, in South Korea. In this region, the water level of the wetland is automatically adjusted to groundwater owing to continued drying. Here, the surface water, wetland, and groundwater near the A. aquatica habitat were studied using hydrochemical, microbiological, and correlation analyses. The hydrochemical properties-water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), oxidation reduction potential, and turbidity-of the surface water and wetland were similar. The Piper diagrams revealed that the wetlands, surface water, and most of the groundwater portrayed Ca-HCO3-type properties, whereas only areas where the water level of the wetland was controlled displayed Na-HCO3-type properties. Furthermore, the NO3 content was too low to be detected in the wetland, indicating clean and non-polluted water conditions; additionally, heavier oxygen-hydrogen isotopes were observed because these regions were climatically affected by the wetland. The dominant bacteria were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Nitrospirae. The correlation analysis revealed that the major environmental control factors of the A. aquatica habitat were DO, temperature, and pH, and the related bacteria were Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia.

TI Planning green infrastructure to mitigate urban surface water flooding
   risk - A methodology to identify priority areas applied in the city of
   Ghent
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB Urban surface water floods pose growing threats in urban areas, which cause not only massive physical water disturbance, but also loss of human lives, destruction of social and economic infrastructures and disorder of society. The number and scale of flood damage in urban areas will continue to increase in the next several decades due to global trend in urbanization and climate change. Despite the extensive construction of grey infrastructures, many cities in the world remain vulnerable to surface water flooding, especially during the extremely weather events. Since the 1990s, green infrastructure has developed as an alternative and sustainable approach to mitigate flood hazard in urban areas. Despite the great effectiveness of urban green infrastructures in alleviating storm water runoff, there is comparatively little research for planners and designers to determine an appropriate strategy for green infrastructure planning. To address this gap, we propose a GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation method to identify the priority areas to site green infrastructure, based on five criteria: 1) storm-water runoff mitigation; 2) social flood vulnerable group protection; 3) flood sensitive area road infrastructures protection; 4) flood sensitive area buildings protection and 5) environmental justice. The weights of the five criteria are defined by the Analytic Hierarchy Process. We focus particularly on mitigating urban surface water flooding risk and demonstrate how the method can be applied using a case study of Ghent.

AB The data stored in the IAEA's Global Marine Radioactivity Database (GLOMARD) developed in the framework of the IAEA's project "Worldwide Marine Radioactivity Studies (WOMARS)" have been evaluated for Pacific and Indian Ocean surface waters. Four anthropogenic radionuclides-H-3, Sr-90, Cs-137 and Pu-239,Pu-240-have been chosen as the most representative of anthropogenic radioactivity in the marine environment, comprising beta, gamma and alpha-emitters which are the most frequently analysed in the marine environment and which have (with the exception of tritium) the highest potential contribution to radiation doses to humans via seafood consumption. For the purposes of this study, the Pacific and Indian Oceans were divided into latitudinal boxes for which average radionuclide concentrations were estimated for the year 2000. The highest concentrations have been observed in the Japan Sea/East Sea and the North-West Pacific Ocean, the lowest in the Southern Ocean. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Evolution of the groundwater system under the impacts of human
   activities in middle reaches of Heihe River Basin (Northwest China) from
   1985 to 2013
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Investigation of the evolution of the groundwater system and its mechanisms is critical to the sustainable management of water in river basins. Temporal and spatial distributions and characteristics of groundwater have undergone a tremendous change with the intensity of human activities in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin (HRB), the second largest arid inland river basin in northwestern China. Based on groundwater observation data, hydrogeological data, meteorological data and irrigation statistical data, combined with geostatistical analyses and groundwater storage estimation, the basin-scaled evolution of the groundwater levels and storage (from 1985 to 2013) were investigated. The results showed that the unbalanced allocation of water sources and expanded cropland by policy-based human activities resulted in the over-abstraction of groundwater, which induced a general decrease in the water table and groundwater storage. The groundwater level has generally fallen from 4.92 to 11.49 m from 1985 to 2013, especially in the upper and middle parts of the alluvial fan (zone I), and reached a maximum depth of 17.41 m. The total groundwater storage decreased by 177.52 x 10(8) m(3); zone I accounted for about 94.7 % of the total decrease. The groundwater balance was disrupted and the groundwater system was in a severe negative balance; it was noted that the groundwater/surface-water interaction was also deeply affected. It is essential to develop a rational plan for integration and management of surface water and groundwater resources in the HRB.

TI Trace elements speciation and sources characterization in the main
   watercourses, middle-upper Egypt
SO HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT
AB Water contamination by mutagenic microchemicals is a worldwide problem. To evaluate the overall water quality and identify the source(s) of pollutants (B, Fe, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Cd, and Cr) in different watercourses in middle-upper Egypt, we analyzed 66 surface water samples collected from the significant waterways. In addition to trace pollutants, 15 physicochemical parameters (pH, Temperature, EC, alkalinity, DO, BOD, COD, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3 (-), SO4 (2-), Cl-, and NO3 (-)) were measured. Multivariate statistical approaches such as exploratory principal component analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis, and correlation matrix analysis were applied to explore the sources of the contaminants. Data reveal that surface water quality in the investigated area is threatened by high concentrations of trace elements, which are higher than the permissible limits recommended by WHO guidelines and Egyptian standards for drinking water and irrigation purposes. Statistical analyses suggest that surface water contamination is the result of interference of natural (geogenic related to rock-water interaction) and human (interrelated to agrogenic and domestic sewage) inputs. The study will help decision-makers to take appropriate actions for freshwater sustainable management and protection. Moreover, surface water should be treated before use for drinking purposes.

TI Impact of hydroclimatic variability on regional-scale landscape
   connectivity across a dynamic dryland region
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB In dynamic dryland regions, accounting for spatiotemporal landscape dynamics is essential to understanding how ecological habitat networks are affected by hydroclimatic variability at regional or sub-continental scales. Here we assess how changes in the distribution and availability of surface water influence potential landscape connectivity for water-dependent organisms by combining graph theory network analysis with a Landsat-derived, seasonally continuous 25-year surface-water time-series. We focused on Australia's Murray Darling Basin (MDB), a globally significant and ecologically stressed 1 million km(2) semi-arid region recently affected by two unprecedented hydroclimatic extremes: the 1997-2010 Millennium Drought and 2010-2012 La Nina floods. We constructed potential habitat networks for two dispersal abilities using circuit theory resistance distances, and used 'habitat availability' graph theory metrics as indicators of regional-scale connectivity. We analysed 792 unique potential habitat networks containing over 6.6 million nodes, making our study one of the largest spatially explicit ecological network analyses yet conducted. Our indicators of connectivity revealed consistently positive but spatially heterogeneous relationships between flooded habitat area and landscape connectivity. Connectivity increased by over two orders of magnitude along the spectrum from severe drought to flood, associated with a transition from connectivity driven by intra-habitat or short-distance dispersal during drought to long-distance dispersal during wet conditions. Reductions in connectivity during drought were lower than expected given equivalent decreases in surface water habitat area, suggesting habitat network structure provides a degree of resistance to dry conditions. By providing insights into the processes driving connectivity during different phases along the drought-flood spectrum, our approach may assist in guiding conservation management aimed at maintaining or improving landscape connectivity within dynamic environments faced with increasing hydroclimatic variability.

TI Seasonal distribution of herbicide and insecticide residues in the water
   resources of the vineyard region of La Rioja (Spain)
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Pesticides are needed to maintain high production in the vineyard area of La Rioja (Spain), and monitoring, their spatial distribution is a priority for preserving the quality of natural resources. Accordingly, the purpose of this work was to conduct a study to evaluate the presence and seasonal distribution of herbicide and insecticide residues in ground and surface waters in this region. The monitoring network comprised 12 surface waters and 78 groundwaters, covering the three subareas (63,593 ha) into which the vineyard region is divided. The quality of natural waters was examined through the analysis of twenty-two herbicides, eight of their main degradation products, and eight insecticides. Pesticides were extracted by solid-phase extraction, and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or by liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results reveal the presence of most of the herbicides and insecticides included in the study in one or more of the samples collected during the foul campaigns. The herbicide terbuthylazine its metabolite desethylterbuthylazine were the compounds more frequently detected (present in >65% of the samples across all the campaigns). Other compounds detected in >50% of the samples in one sampling campaign were the herbicides fluometuron, metolachlor alachlor and ethofumesate. Insecticides were present in a small number of samples, with only pirimicarb being detected in >25% of the samples in March and June campaigns. The results reveal that the sum of compounds detected (mainly herbicides) was higher than 05 mu g L-1 in >50% of the samples, especially in the campaigns with the highest application of these compounds. A possible recovery of the quality of the waters was detected outside the periods of crop cultivation, although more monitoring programmes are needed to confirm this trend with a view to preventing and or maintaining the sustainability of natural resources.

AB Two nonpoint source (NPS) pollutants routinely detected in southern Alabama are soil sediments and phosphates. The presence of these contaminants in surface waters is influenced by agricultural land use practices. The use of a validated computer model would be helpful in predicting the impact of site specific conditions, weather, and agricultural practices on the potential for soil sediments and phosphates to load and contaminate surface waters and riparian wetlands. The GLEAMS model with subroutines for surface hydrology, erosion, and nutrient and vegetation dynamics appears to be suited to assess the long term effects of land use practices on soil erosion and phosphorus behavior in agricultural landscapes. A study was initiated in 1998 to evaluate the use of the GLEAMS model as an environmental planning tool at four test sites in the Choctawhatche, Pea, Yellow Rivers Watershed (CPYRW) in southern Alabama. The objectives of the research were: 1) to predict the long term (25 years) impact of agricultural management practices on rates of soil erosion and the subsequent transport of phosphates, and 2) to assess the long term contamination hazard associated with soil sediment and phosphate loading of surface waters and riparian wetlands. Site specific agricultural practices, soil physical and chemical variables, cropping systems, and phosphorus inputs were field determined or obtained from USDA soil survey reports, knowledgeable landowners, and the Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS) for the four test sites. A 5-year regional weather data base was used as the reference weather file. Long term weather used in the GLEAMS model was developed using the WXGEN weather generator. Based on preliminary GLEAMS simulations, transported soil sediments and phosphates were a short and long term NPS pollution hazard in certain areas of the CPYRW. Alternative land use scenarios were developed, model inputs modified, and new simulations completed. The GLEAMS model appears to be useful in identifying contamination hazard areas and in developing sustainable alternatives. Emphasis was placed on developing new management strategies that reduced runoff volume; subsequently organic sediment phosphorus, particulate phosphorus (soil adsorbed), and soil sediments were reduced. Results from this study will be used to develop environmentally sound agricultural management practices for the CPYRW.

TI Estimating exploitable amount of groundwater abstraction using an

SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
AB A holistic approach to groundwater sustainability considers the hydrological, ecological, socio-economic and technological aspects of groundwater utilization. Exploitable groundwater should be determined by physical analysis, as well as by social compromises within a community. In this work, an integrated surface water-groundwater model, SWAT-MODFLOW, is used to examine changes in hydrological components due to various groundwater pumping scenarios in the Mihocheon watershed of South Korea. Under a total groundwater abstraction of 104 mm, which is slightly less than the amount currently permissible by law, a change in storage levels of -16 mm occurred. This abstraction value, which corresponds to 33% of the annual recharge, may be an exploitable groundwater reserve available to Cheongju City, Korea.

TI Water quality changes in the world's first special economic zone,

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB Shenzhen, as the first special economic zone in the world, has been in the process of rapid urbanization for 30 years. Many special economic zones have been established in China and other nations following Shenzhen's experience. However, Shenzhen has attained significant economic development with an attendant cost of environmental degradation, and similar results may be seen in other zones in the future. Here we use a pollution index method to evaluate the effect of such rapid urban development on the surface water quality in Shenzhen from 1991 to 2008. Rapid urbanization has affected surface water quality, but environmental policies can mitigate some of these effects, although such policy-induced improvements required some time before showing efficacy. As their use of special economic zones proliferates worldwide, greater consideration of the potential effects on water quality, and their overall sustainability, must receive greater attention.

TI Novel Threshold Self-Regulating Water Extraction Method
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
AB Water resources are crucial for human activities and sustainable socioeconomic development. Understanding surface water information can play a key role in water resource management, which affects the global water cycle and ecological environments. Considering the Hailar River water body as an example, this study proposes a new threshold self-learning water body extraction method (TSLWEM) based on modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) data. The optimal water extraction thresholds determined by the TSLWEM algorithm for four test images were -0.0030, 0, 0.1990, and -0.0800. The TSLWEM algorithm effectively identified the target water body with recognition accuracies of 98.08%, 99.93%, 93.39%, and 93.20% for the four test images. Moreover, it can accurately identify small tributaries, such as lakes and rivers. The TSLWEM algorithm is suitable for Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data, which can effectively monitor and map complex surface water in temperate and semiarid regions while improving the accuracy of water body identification. The study's findings provide technical support for the protection of water resources as well as their rational utilization and monitoring.

TI Multi-objective optimization for allocation of surface water and
   groundwater resources
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Many developing countries face water deficit due to various reasons such as population growth, limited surface water resources, uneven spatial and temporal distributions of precipitation, industrialization, climate change, and lack of efficient management. This fact has led to a significant reduction in water resources, which has further caused water conflicts among the stakeholders. Hence, developing comprehensive water allocation policies to account for social standards, economic efficiency, and environmental sustainability is necessary. The objective of this study is to integrate the system dynamics simulation-optimization technique, and the Nash bargaining theory for optimal allocations of water resources. The proposed simulation, optimization, and conflict resolution modeling approach was applied for the joint allocation of surface water and groundwater among drinking, industrial, agricultural, and environmental sectors in the Najaf-Abad sub-basin in Iran. To obtain the Pareto front, the NSGA-II multi-objective optimization algorithm was used to maximize the water supply (i.e., minimize the water deficit) (objective function 1) and also minimize the groundwater extraction from the Najaf-Abad aquifer (objective function 2) over the entire operation period. The decision variables, the percentages of surface water and groundwater extractions, were determined for a set of optimal solutions. The optimum water supply (objective function 1) was 16.84 x 10(6) m(3) and the optimum reduction of the water table of the aquifer (objective function 2) was 0.63 m, representing an improvement of 30% over the existing condition. This study demonstrates the ability of the proposed simulation optimization-conflict resolution modeling approach and its applicability for water resources allocation. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI Hydrological drought evolution with a nonlinear joint index in regions
   with significant changes in underlying surface
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB It is critical important to accurately evaluate hydrological drought evolutions based on a composite index for the sustainable development of water resources. In this study, a Nonlinear Joint Hydrological Drought Index (NJHDI) is constructed by combining surface water and groundwater to better reflect the multivariate phenomenon in characterizing hydrological drought. The bi-dimensional copula function is applied to describe the complicated and nonlinear relationship between surface water and groundwater due to its dependence structure and flexibility. To reflect the changes in underlying surface, the time-varying parameters are applied in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to simulate the surface water and groundwater more accurately. Based on the NJHDI, the spatio-temporal hydrological drought evolutions as well as their potential influencing factors are analyzed in a case study of the Yellow River Basin (YRB). Results indicate that 1) compared to the single hydrological index, the NJHDI is more sensitive and effective to capture historically droughts; 2) hydrological droughts became increasingly serious during the last few decades, especially in parts of the basin located in the Loess Plateau areas where the ecosystem is extremely fragile; 3) climate and LULC changes have both contributed to the changes in hydrological droughts but their contributions vary significantly spatially. In general, the NJHDI-based hydrological drought evolution can provide more reliable information in hydrological drought decision-making owing to considering changes in underlying land surface, and combining the surface water and groundwater with nonlinear combination method.

TI A review of managed nitrate addition to enhance surface water quality
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Nitrate is a significant water pollutant with potential environmental impacts ranging from eutrophication to health risks to infants. But under certain circumstances nitrate may enhance water quality through a number of mechanisms, including enhancing oxidant capacity, regulation of redox potential, and suppression of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. In this review the authors explore a range of case studies in which nitrate addition enhanced surface water quality including: purposeful addition of nitrate salts to lakes to repress internal phosphorus (P) loading, enhance organic matter oxidation, or impede bottom-water accumulation of methylmercury; purposeful and incidental addition of nitrate from point and nonpoint discharges to reservoirs and lakes; nitrogen (N) addition to lakes to affect phytoplankton and zooplankton composition; and nitrate addition to estuary sediment to repress hydrogen sulfide production. Nitrate addition decreased internal P and methylmercury loading, repressed sulfide production, and enhanced surface water quality by lowering total P, chlorophyll content, and phytoplankton dominance by cyanobacteria. No case study reported a worsening of eutrophic conditions due to nitrate addition, and a number of studies reported near complete loss of nitrate from the systems to which it was added. When purposely adding nitrate to anoxic surface waters, protocols should be used to maximize nitrate loss via biological denitrification but minimize enhancement of phytoplankton productivity. These protocols should include adding nitrate close to the sediment-water interface to promote nitrate loss via denitrification, managing the timing and magnitude of nitrate addition so that nitrate is depleted prior lake overturn in the fall, and not adding nitrate to N-limited systems. Elimination of existing N discharges to receiving waters should be implemented on a case-by-case basis with the awareness that nitrate in discharges may enhance surface water quality, particularly by suppressing internal P loading and associated phytoplankton productivity. In addition, managers and regulators should look to couple existing nitrate discharges with hypoxic water bodies in an effort to sustainably enhance water quality while removing nitrate from aquatic ecosystems via biological denitrification.

TI Modelling pesticides transfer to surface water at the catchment scale: a
   multi-criteria analysis
SO AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The demand for operational tools at a catchment scale is growing to assess both the sustainability of agricultural practices and the efficiency of mitigation measures on pesticide transfer to surface water. Here a literature review of 286 investigations highlights the large number of indicators and hydrochemical models developed at the catchment scale. Given this large number of indicators and models, the choice is difficult for potential users. Therefore, this article proposes a multi-criteria analysis applied to ten existing tools including physically based and conceptual models, indicators and multi-agent systems. We found the following major points: (1) Indicators and conceptual models are the most popular approaches to assess the transfer of pesticides to surface water at the catchment scale due to a trade-off between environmental relevance and adaptation to user's needs. (2) The latest indicators developed are inferred from the results of conceptual or physically based models to combine the strengths of each approach. (3) Only a handful of physically based models have addressed both flow and pesticide transport at the catchment as affected by the internal heterogeneity of the system. However, it is only physically based models that can simulate the impact of changes to the catchment. Physically based models integrate feedbacks between hydrological and chemical processes not possible from conceptual models or indicators alone. (4) The ability of models to assess the pesticide loads both in the dissolved and particulate phases is a key issue not properly addressed by many indicators or models. A key way forward is the integration of erosion processes with the fate of pesticide adsorbed to these particles. (5) At the catchment, the hydrological connectivity is perhaps the primary hydrological variable required to correctly assess rapid flow processes as surface runoff and associated pesticide transfer. This in turn implies using tools that explicitly represent the connectedness of surface and/or sub-surface water pathways including mitigation measures to correctly assess the risk of pesticide transfer.

   drinking surface waters in remote areas of Arequipa-Peru
SO NEXO REVISTA CIENTIFICA
AB A physicochemical treatment system for surface water has been designed and manufactured to provide drinking water to remote areas that do not have access to basic service. The system consists of four main units; the first: pre-treatment, it filters the particles and sediments present in the water from a nearby surface source; the second unit: primary treatment; doses chemical inputs for coagulation and generation of flocs to sediment the particles as sludge and remove them later; the third secondary treatment unit; Filters microscopic particles and microbial or pathogenic agents and water is chlorinated to provide the required drinking quality according to regulations. The fourth unit, energy generation; It takes advantage of solar radiation and converts it into electrical energy so that the equipment operates properly. The results indicate that it is feasible to implement the proposed system to provide water suitable for human and in compliance with the standards of the current national regulations intended mainly for vulnerable communities.

TI Water Debt Indicator Reveals Where Agricultural Water Use Exceeds
   Sustainable Levels
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB Agriculture overexploits water resources in many regions, as water stress metrics highlight. Tracing back the causes of water overuses and separately accounting for soil water, surface water and groundwater resources is an open challenge to monitor the sustainability of agricultural water use. We introduce the water debt repayment time indicator, measuring the time required to replenish water resources used for annual crop production. This indicator disentangles source- and crop-specific water overuses at a high spatial resolution. Globally, we find that wheat and rice production critically overuses groundwater resources and cotton production overuses both surface water and groundwater. Locally, unsustainable production is found over the Sabarmati Basin and in the Chao Phraya Basin, where the repayment time exceeds 5years in many cultivated areas. Critical overuses are also found over the High Plain and Indo-Gangetic Plains, where the repayment times reach 50years. Unsustainable irrigation is often a consequence of growing crops during local dry seasons.

TI Investigating Summer Dynamics of the Nutrients in Lake Aktas (Ardahan)
   Surface Water, Using Geographic Information Systems
SO JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-COGRAFYA DERGISI
AB Lake Aktas is a tectonic lake with a total surface area of 25.5 km(2) (11.7 km(2) in Ardahan, Turkey; 13.8 km2 in Georgia). This study investigated water quality of the lake, a crucial element in protecting the ecological characteristics of a lake, and ensuring its sustainable use. The study involved use of Geographical Information Systems software to analyze the temporal and spatial changes in nutrient element concentrations that may deteriorate water quality and ecological characteristics of the lake. In the framework of the study, surface water samples were collected on the Lake Aktas in June, July, and August 2014 from nine stations selected at intervals in accordance with spatial analysis. The collected samples were measured for temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, and orthophosphate. The obtained results were compared with the concentrations specified in Surface Water Quality Management Regulation published by the T. R. Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. According to the findings, surface water classification and distribution for Lake Aktas included the following categories class I ( WS-I/natural) in terms of oxygen, ammonium, and nitrate nitrogen, and class II (WS-II/undeveloped) in terms of nitrite. It was found that ammonium and phosphate levels have considerably increased in the last ten years, based on the comparisons made with the study sampled in Aktas Lake during 2004-2005 (Ozbay and Kilinc 2008).

TI Interaction of aquifer-wetland in a zone of intensive agriculture: the
   case of Campo de Dalias (Almeria, SE Spain)
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
AB The Campo de Dalias (Almeria, south-eastern Spain) was the backdrop for the development of intensive agricultural activity during the 1970s. Due to the poor natural soil development, the agriculturalists opted for a system that involved quarrying silt and clay deposits that could be used as soil in the greenhouses. In parallel, poor water quality in the upper aquifer caused the gradual abandonment of boreholes and a generalised rise in piezometric levels. These factors have favoured the formation of a series of artificial wetlands in the abandoned clay pits (Onayar, Cabriles and Balsa del Sapo ("Toad Pond") being the most significant). In Balsa del Sapo, the water column rose 3.5 m between October 2007 and February 2011. There has been a continuous fall in the electrical conductivity of the surface water, which has gone from 14,500 A mu S cm(-1) in 2004 to 4,100 A mu S cm(-1) in 2013. The most recent concentrations are close to those found in the groundwater. The same situation is detected for Cl, SO4 and Na ion concentrations in the surface and groundwater. These data show the groundwater-surface water interaction in the Balsa del Sapo. Nevertheless, the sharp rise in surface water level has created a flood hazard (due to the shallow topography of the area), both for people living in the vicinity and their property. This is an endorheic zone where a number of ramblas (gullies) draining the southern face of the Sierra de Gador mountains converge. The Campo de Dalias is a spectacular example of the changes that can occur in a semiarid agricultural area as a result of intensive groundwater abstraction. These changes are directly related to the management of water resources, the most recent consequence of which is the increased risk of flooding. Hence, there is a need to consider the management of these water resources to achieve a more sustainable use, which is compatible with the environmental protection of the wetland and which will give some guarantee of flood protection for people and property.

TI Residual Characteristics of Atrazine and Its Metabolites in the Liaoning
   Province of China
SO SEPARATIONS
AB The simultaneous determination of atrazine residue and its metabolites was developed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in Liaoning Province, China. To ensure agricultural production and environmental safety, their contamination level was assessed. A total of 2142 samples were collected between 2014 and 2020, including 1213 soil samples, 190 surface water samples, and 739 groundwater samples. The overall pollution level and detectable level of the herbicides in Liaoning Province was found to be the highest in soil followed by surface water and groundwater. The residual level of the analytes in the collected samples decreased in the following order: atrazine > hydroxyatrazine > desethylatrazine > desisopropylatrazine. From 2014 to 2020, atrazine was detected in soil and surface water, whereas hydroxyatrazine was found in soil without the selected analytes detected in groundwater. The pollution of atrazine in soil was higher than that of hydroxyatrazine, desethylatrazine, and desisopropylatrazine. To maintain sustainable agricultural development, it is critical to pay attention to the residual determination of atrazine in the environment.

TI Microplastics Occurrence in Surface Waters and Sediments in Five River
   Mouths of Manila Bay
SO FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Microplastics have been increasingly documented globally in numerous environmental compartments. However, little information exists in the Philippines despite the fact that the country is considered to be one of the largest contributors of plastics in oceans. This study, considered as one of the pioneering microplastic research, evaluated the abundance, distribution, and composition of microplastic pollution in the mouths of five rivers, namely Canas, Meycauayan, Paranaque, Pasig and Tullahan, draining to Manila Bay. Surface water and sediments samples were collected, then passed through a stack of sieves with sizes from 2.36 mm at the top to 0.075 mm at the bottom. These samples were digested to remove organic matter, and salt solutions were added to allow the microplastics to float. Extracted particles were examined under a stereo microscope, and quantified and categorized into shape, size, color, and type. Results show that microplastics were present ubiquitously at all river mouths but with concentrations varying from 1,580 to 57,665 particles/m(3) (surface water) and 386 to 1,357 particles/kg (dry sediment). Fragment was the most abundant shape, while white, blue, and transparent were the most prevalent colors. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis revealed that polypropylene (PP), high and low-density polyethylene (high-density polyethylene and low-density polyethylene) and polystyrene were the main types of microplastics present in the river mouths.</p>

TI Thorium Concentrations in the Environment: A Review of the Global Data
SO BIOLOGY BULLETIN
AB A review of the world data on the concentrations of thorium activity concentrations in soils, the atmosphere, surface waters, and bottom sediments is presented. It is shown that in the areas with normal radiation background the Th-232 concentrations vary from 5 to 95 Bq/kg in the soil , from 1.0 x 10(-5) to 1.0 x 10(-2) Bq/L in the aquatic environment, from 4 to 100 Bq/kg in bottom sediments of surface waters, from 0.6 x 10(-7) to 1.0 x 10(-4) Bq/L in groundwater, and from 0.1 to 1 x 10(-4) Bq/m(3) in the surface air. The thorium concentrations in those environments can range from one to four orders of magnitude higher in areas with an elevated radiation background and thorium, rare earth, or tin mining areas than in areas with normal radiation background. It is also demonstrated that data on violation in the isotopic equilibrium of the thorium content in various media can be used to assess the pathways of thorium release into the environment. It is noted that the spatial patterns of thorium concentrations are rather close in the soil and bottom sediments and differ from the patterns of thorium distribution in surface waters.

TI Conjunctive Management of Surface Water and Groundwater Resources under
   Drought Conditions Using a Fully Coupled Hydrological Model
SO JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB A conjunctive management model has been developed to obtain optimal allocation of surface water and groundwater under different constraints during a drought. Two simulation modelsa fully distributed hydrologic model and a reservoir simulation modelwere incorporated in an optimization formulation using a simulation-optimization approach with response functions. The model was tested for the Haw River Basin located in North Carolina. A fully distributed hydrologic model, penn state integrated hydrologic model (PIHM), was used to compute simultaneous depletions in streamflow and groundwater level under pumping. A reservoir simulation model was then incorporated within the optimization framework to determine the optimal allocation of surface water and groundwater resources by minimizing reservoir deficit. A new groundwater sustainability constraint, recovery time for groundwater levels, was introduced in the conjunctive management model. Incorporating the reservoir simulation model within the optimization model resulted in reduced reservoir deficits. Moreover, the recovery time constraint will allow decision makers to evaluate the trade-off between maximizing water availability and preserving groundwater sustainability during a drought. It is envisioned that the management model proposed in this study is a step toward sustainable groundwater withdrawal during a drought.

TI Assessing the pollution status, ecological and health risks of surface
   waters in Nnewi urban, Nigeria: implications of poor waste disposal
SO ENVIRONMENTAL FORENSICS
AB Following the high rate at which many drinking water sources are polluted globally, an adequate evaluation of the potential hazards posed by polluted water systems is essential. In Nnewi urban (southeastern Nigeria), inhabitants indiscriminately dispose municipal solid wastes into streams and rivers, thereby exposing the surface water quality to deterioration. The aim of this study was to assess the pollution status, ecological risks, and probabilistic health risks of surface waters in this area using integrated study approach. Several heavy metal pollution indices used in this study showed that the waters generally have low pollution. However, Pb was identified as the priority pollutant. Ecological risk assessment revealed that the samples pose low ecological risk. Furthermore, non-carcinogenic risk assessment revealed low chronic risk; but children are more exposed to chronic risk due to ingestion than adults. However, with respect to dermal contact, all the samples pose negligible risks to both populations, as their hazard indices were <0.1. The probability of cancer risk, when compared to the acceptable range of <= 1 x 10(-6) to 1 x 10(-4), revealed that many of the samples pose carcinogenic risk due to Pb ingestion to adults (75%) and children (100%). However, all the samples pose negligible cancer risk due to dermal contact. Water quality index revealed that majority (75%) of the samples are poor quality water, and thus not recommended for drinking purpose. Correlation and factor analyses showed that both geogenic and anthropogenic factors influence the presence of the analytes in the surface waters.

AB Aspects of reducing the resource potential of surface waters of the Murmansk region in the global climate change and the environment and their irrational use have been considered. Increase of aquatic environment toxicity, drastic restructuring of the structural and functional characteristics of aquatic communities, changes in trophic status of lakes, reducing the stability of freshwater ecosystems, increasing the risk of catastrophic degradation have been shown. Taking into account the regional peculiarities, some indicators of surface water quality in the Murmansk region have been proposed.

TI Impacts of soil, climate, and phenology on retention of dissolved
   agricultural nutrients by permanent-cover buffers
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Nutrient losses from farms affects environmental and human health, but retention by riparian buffers can vary by nu-trient identity, flow path, soil texture, seasonality, and buffer width. On conventional farms with corn, we test the re-lationships between levels of dissolved nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in downslope surface-water, and flow paths relating to porewater in soils (to 40 cm deep), groundwater of the saturated zone (to 2.5 m deep), soil nutrient pools, and changes in plant biomass and tissue quality by season. We found that the major drivers of surface-water nu-trients were multi-factor and nutrient-specific, variously relating to soil, climate, vegetation uptake, and tiling on clay soils. N retention was best explained by soil type, with 10 times more surface-water N in the sand versus clay setting, despite identical fertilization rates on corn. P retention was best explained by precipitation and time of year. Vegeta-tion uptake was strongest for shallow-soil porewater, and was greatest in buffers where root biomass was 20 times greater by weight. We were unable to detect any impact of vegetative uptake on groundwater nutrients. Overall, peak nutrient inputs to surface-water were in early summer, fall, and winter - all times when plant uptake is low. Buffers appear to be a necessary component of nutrient capture on farms, but insufficient unless partnered with mea-sures that reduce nutrient flows at times when plants are inactive.

TI Global maps of lake surface water temperatures reveal pitfalls of
   air-for-water substitutions in ecological prediction
SO ECOGRAPHY
AB In modeling species distributions and population dynamics, spatially-interpolated climatic data are often used as proxies for real, on-the-ground measurements. For shallow freshwater systems, this practice may be problematic as interpolations used for surface waters are generated from terrestrial sensor networks measuring air temperatures. Using these may therefore bias statistical estimates of species' environmental tolerances or population projections - particularly among pleustonic and epilimnetic organisms. Using a global database of millions of daily satellite-derived lake surface water temperatures (LSWT), I trained machine learning models to correct for the correspondence between air and LSWT as a function of atmospheric and topographic predictors, resulting in the creation of monthly high-resolution global maps of air-LSWT offsets, corresponding uncertainty measures and derived LSWT-based bioclimatic layers for use by the scientific community. I then compared the performance of these LSWT layers and air temperature-based layers in population dynamic and ecological niche models (ENM). While generally high, the correspondence between air temperature and LSWT was quite variable and often nonlinear depending on the spatial context. These LSWT predictions were better able to capture the modeled population dynamics and geographic distributions of two common aquatic plant species. Further, ENM models trained with LSWT predictors more accurately captured lab-measured thermal response curves. I conclude that these predicted LSWT temperatures perform better than raw air temperatures when used for population projections and environmental niche modeling, and should be used by practitioners to derive more biologically-meaningful results. These global LSWT predictions and corresponding error estimates and bioclimatic layers have been made freely available to all researchers in a permanent archive.

TI Saltwater Intrusion in a Mediterranean Delta Under a Changing Climate
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Saltwater intrusion (SWI) in deltas, estuaries, and other coastal areas represents a pressing problem affecting the sustainability of freshwater resources. Observations and numerical experiments are used to investigate SWI in the surface waters of the Italian's largest river delta (the Po Delta) under low discharge conditions. The model successfully reproduced the observed salinity variations along main river branches and in the delta lagoons and investigated fresh and saltwater dynamics during the entire summer 2017. The numerical model is used to explore the hydrological response of the delta system to climate change. The relative effect of controlling factors on saltwater penetration, such as sea-level rise (SLR), air-sea fluxes, and reduction of river discharge, was evaluated. Results suggest that changes driven by climate and SLR will exacerbate SWI in the surface waters of the Po Delta system. Extent of SWI in the major river branch is projected to increase up to 80% further into the river. Persistence of SWI at the same site is expected to increase 100% longer. Moreover, additional synthetic simulations were used to investigate the sensitivity of SWI to several river discharges and relative SLR values, highlighting the effects of the two factors in the delta. Such results show different combinations of river discharge and relative SLR values that represent possible scenarios, and are important for managing SWI in river-sea systems affected by both climatic and anthropogenic factors such as discharge changes from dam construction, land use, and irrigation.

TI Assessment of surface water quality around opencast coal mines for
   sustainable utilization potentials: a case study in Jharkhand, India
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB Opencast coal mining has caused severe environmental degradation globally. In India, Jharkhand is infamous for the environmental damage already caused by unregulated coal mining practices so far. In the present investigation, surface water samples from 31 locations in Charhi and Kuju coal mining areas were analysed for physical and chemical parameters of water. Statistical analysis was performed to understand the magnitude of contamination and suitability of the water samples for agricultural as well as domestic uses. Analysis of variance indicated significant site-wise (6 out of 15 parameters) and seasonal variations (13 out of 15 parameters), while Pearson correlation indicated significant positive correlations between TDS-EC (r(2) = 0.74-0.99) and total hardness-HCO3- (r(2) = 0.95-0.98). Scatter plot between Ca, Mg and HCO3 revealed a positive interrelationship in all the three seasons. Surface water quality indices exhibited variable results of sustainable utilization potential of the water for various uses. Though water quality index advocated the quality of water to be good in the majority of the samples, health water quality index based on selected parameters hinted, the majority of the samples to be of poor category. Observations collated together suggest that though the area is in the initial phases of mining, contamination of the surface water bodies is increasing gradually and higher concentrations of metals (As, Fe, Mn, Se) are the most significant problem now. This study can serve as a baseline data and an early sentinel towards the increasing pollution and its effective environmental management in similar mining regions of the world.

TI Impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on the wastewater pathway into surface
   water: A review
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB With global number of cases 106 million and death toll surpassing 2.3 million as of mid-February 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic is certainly one of the major threats that humankind have faced in modern history. As the scientific community navigates through the overwhelming avalanche of information on the multiple health impacts caused by the pandemic, new reports start to emerge on significant ancillary effects associated with the treatment of the virus. Besides the evident health impacts, other emerging impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as water-related impacts, merits in-depth investigation. This includes strategies for the identification of these impacts and technologies to mitigate them, and to prevent further impacts not only in water ecosystems, but also in relation to human health. This paper has critically reviewed currently available knowledge on the most significant potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the wastewater pathway into surface water, as well as technologies that may serve to counteract the major threats posed, key perspectives and challenges. Additionally, current knowledge gaps and potential directions for further research and development are identified. While the COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing and rapidly evolving situation, compiling current knowledge of potential links between wastewater and surface water pathways as related to environmental impacts and relevant associated technologies, as presented in this review, is a critical step to guide future research in this area.

TI Recovery of energetically overexploited urban aquifers using surface
   water
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB Shallow aquifers have an important role in reducing greenhouse gases through helping manage the temperature of urban environments. Nevertheless, the uncontrolled rapid use of shallow groundwater resources to heat or cool urban environments can cause thermal pollution that will limit the long term sustainability of the resource. Therefore, there is a need for appropriate mitigation/remediation strategies capable of recovering energetically overexploited aquifers. In this work, a novel remediation strategy based on surface water recharge into aquifers is presented. To evaluate the capabilities of such measures for effective remediation, this strategy is optimized for a management problem raised in the overheated "Urban Alluvial Aquifer of Zaragoza" (Spain). The application of a transient groundwater flow and heat transport model under 512 different mitigation scenarios has enabled to quantify and discuss the magnitude of the remediation effect as a respond to injection rates of surface water, seasonal schedule of the injection and location of injection. The quantification of the relationship between these variables together with the evaluation of the amount of surface water injected per year in each scenario proposed have provided a better understanding of the system processes and an optimal management alternative. This work also makes awareness of the magnitude of the remediation procedure which is in an order of magnitude of tenths of years. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water accounting, i.e. identifying, quantifying and reporting information of water flow in a system, is the first step towards formulating productive and sustainable water management strategies in a region. This requires a significant effort of monitoring, collecting and modelling hydro-meteorological information over both spatial and temporal scales. A number of catchment water balance models developed in Australia and overseas are capable of estimating runoff, evapotranspiration, and streamflow generated from rainfall received in a catchment. However, most existing catchment water balance models do not account for potable water supply, wastewater discharges and surface and groundwater extractions, and yet these components of surface water cycle significantly modify streamflow in peri-urban catchments such as the South Creek catchment in Western Sydney. The South Creek catchment, the main focus of this study, covers an area of around 625 km(2) in gently undulating plains and low hills of Western Sydney. It is a typical example of a peri-urban catchment with urban development over nearly 20% of the land area, and agriculture activities over nearly 17% of the land area. The urban areas in the catchment are serviced with potable water supply from dams outside the catchment, and there are five sewage treatment plants which discharge treated effluent into the South Creek and its tributaries. There are also annual access entitlements to extract water from surface water and groundwater sources mainly for irrigation purposes.
   In this paper, we describe the development of a simple conceptual water balance model to account for rainfall, runoff, evapotranspiration, potable water supply, wastewater discharges and surface water and groundwater extractions in a peri-urban catchment. The rainfall-runoff (from infiltration excess, saturation excess and baseflow) and evapotranspiration are simulated using a daily time step rainfall-runoff model, i.e. SIMHYD, for both pervious and impervious surfaces in the catchment. The developed model further combines the modelling of daily rainfall-runoff with monthly potable water supply, wastewater flows, and surface and groundwater extractions to simulate complete surface water cycle of a peri-urban catchment. The input data for the model include daily rainfall, daily potential evapotranspiration, monthly potable water supply, and annual surface water and groundwater access entitlements. Using the annual surface water and groundwater access entitlements as input, the model estimates monthly surface and groundwater extraction amounts depending on water requirement and water availability in the catchment.
   The model outputs, on a monthly time-step, includes runoff from infiltration excess, saturation excess and baseflow over pervious areas; stormwater from impervious areas, evapotranspiration from both pervious and impervious areas; residential, non-residential and primary production water use, and monthly surface water and groundwater extractions. The estimated monthly residential and non-residential water uses are further separated into the indoor and outdoor components, and finally estimated are the monthly wastewater discharges and streamflow in a catchment. The developed conceptual water balance model has been tested to estimate monthly water balance components of surface water cycle in the South Creek and its subcatchments over 15 years period (1992 to 2006). The calculated statistical measures such as the coefficient of efficiency (E), the coefficient of determination (R(2)), the ratio of mean simulated and observed (Y) and the coefficient of mass residual (CRM) between monthly observed and simulated wastewater discharges, and between monthly observed and simulated streamflow suggest that the model satisfactorily reproduced monthly wastewater discharges and streamflow in the South Creek and its tributaries. The developed conceptual water balance model could be very useful for water accounting or hydrological characterisation, and for simulating the impact of increased impervious surface and potable water supply due to urbanization, and projected climate change on surface water cycle of a peri-urban catchment.

TI Estimation of surface water quality in a Yazoo River tributary using the
   duration curve and recurrence interval approach
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY
AB Pollution of surface water with harmful chemicals and eutrophication of rivers and lakes with excess nutrients are serious environmental concerns. This study estimated surface water quality in a stream within the Yazoo River Basin (YRB), Mississippi, USA, using the duration curve and recurrence interval analysis techniques. Data from the US Geological Survey (USGS) surface water monitoring station located in Deer Creek east of Leland from the YRB were selected for the analysis. Results showed that the water quality constituents, namely water temperature, specific conductivity (SC) and dissolved oxygen (DO), in this stream were found not to be the major concerns as the percentages of the time when these constituents did not meet their criteria were very low. Our results further revealed that the water temperature and SC increased as time elapsed, indicating the potential global warming and contamination impacts in this stream. In contrast, the DO and pH decreased as time elapsed, postulating a potential increase in biochemical oxygen demand and an acidic trend in this stream. Over the last decade, the average recurrence intervals when the water temperature, SC, and DO did not meet their criteria or minimum conditions were around 1 year. Using a target DO value of 429 kg d(-1) proposed by the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, results from this study showed that there was about 25% of the time when the DO load did not meet the target value. This study suggests that the duration curve and recurrence interval analysis techniques are useful statistical tools for water quality trend estimation.

TI Surface water quality and socio-environmental pressures in the upper
   microbasin of the Poas river
SO UNICIENCIA
AB The objective of this research was to determine the quality of surface water in the upper part of the Poas river micro basin and the main socio-environmental pressures that may be related to current quality indices. An exploratory study with a quantitative approach was carried out in which the main socio-environmental pressures experienced by the water resource in the area were identified, while the quality of the surface water was determined based on physical, chemical, and microbiological indicators, as well as the application of two quality indices. Six socio-environmental pressures with a negative impact on the resource were found and related to specific actions carried out in homes and other socio-economic activities. Despite the fact that the evidence showed overall compliance between the analyzed parameters and quality criteria used nationally and internationally, the indices revealed incipient contamination levels, as well as good and medium quality. Statistically, it was found that water quality of the micro-basin does not vary spatially; however, it does vary temporarily due to the incidence of rainfall patterns in the area. This finding, along with the determination of significant correlations between the monitored parameters, contributed to the recognition that the sites monitored in the rainy season have a stronger relationship with parameters associated with organic pollution linked to runoff and wastewater discharge processes. Therefore, it is necessary to coordinate efforts that guarantee sustainability of the micro basin that improve the local sanitary infrastructure, strengthen water management processes, and are focused on the establishment of a monitoring network within a reference framework oriented towards basins.

TI Quantitative structure-activity relationships for primary aerobic
   biodegradation of organic chemicals in pristine surface waters: starting
   points for predicting biodegradation under acclimatization
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS
AB Microbial biomass and acclimation can affect the removal of organic chemicals in natural surface waters. In order to account for these effects and develop more robust models for biodegradation, we have compiled and curated removal data for un-acclimated (pristine) surface waters on which we developed quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). Global analysis of the very heterogeneous dataset including neutral, anionic, cationic and zwitterionic chemicals (N = 233) using a random forest algorithm showed that useful predictions were possible (Q(ext)(2) = 0.4-0.5) though relatively large standard errors were associated (SDEP similar to 0.7). Classification of the chemicals based on speciation state and metabolic pathway showed that biodegradation is influenced by the two, and that the dependence of biodegradation on chemical characteristics is non-linear. Class-specific QSAR analysis indicated that shape and charge distribution determine the biodegradation of neutral chemicals (R-2 similar to 0.6), e.g. through membrane permeation or binding to P450 enzymes, whereas the average biodegradation of charged chemicals is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower, for which degradation depends more directly on cellular uptake (R-2 similar to 0.6). Further analysis showed that specific chemical classes such as peptides and organic halogens are relatively less biodegradable in pristine surface waters, resulting in the need for the microbial consortia to acclimate. Additional literature data was used to verify an acclimation model (based on Monod-type kinetics) capable of extrapolating QSAR predictions to acclimating conditions such as in water treatment, downstream lakes and large rivers under mg L-1 to mg L-1 concentrations. The framework developed, despite being based on multiple assumptions, is promising and needs further validation using experimentation with more standardised and homogenised conditions as well as adequate characterization of the inoculum used.
   Environmental significance
   In this study quantitative structure-property relationship (QSAR) models were developed capable of predicting aerobic biodegradation of both neutral and charged chemicals. The developed models, in combination with Monod-type acclimation kinetics, can be used to predict biodegradation in various surface waters. The methods developed in our study are the first of its kind that allow for robust predictions that were not possible previously.

TI Evaluation of metaheuristic optimization algorithms for optimal
   allocation of surface water and groundwater resources for crop
   production
SO AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB Extensive variability in current climatic conditions necessitates the need for optimal planning of water resources to manage socio-economic and environmental requirements efficiently. The optimal allocation of surface water and groundwater is essential to maximize crop net return due to uncertainty in seasonal rainfall, groundwater, and surface water availability in each region. This study demonstrated a multi-objective model to maximize the crop net return and efficient management of water resources. The multi-objective model comprised three objective functions maximizing the crop net return, minimizing the water deficit, and maximizing the aquifer recharge. The model's practicability was analyzed through the case study of the Pennar-Palar-Cauvery link canal command in India. Three meta-heuristic approaches, particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and marine predators algorithm (MPA), were employed to solve the presented model. And their performance was evaluated using hypervolume and coverage metrics, indicating MPA's superiority in obtaining well-distributed Pareto-optimal solutions. Thus, decision-makers can choose the best feasible solution based on current resource availability and preferences. The model was executed considering different cropping area deviations (5-25%) in the existing cropping pattern and allowance of groundwater mining from 0% to 70%. The obtained cropping pattern utilizing MPA at 25% cropping deviation achieved an increased net return of 1327.05 million INR.

TI Analysis and Model of River Basin Sustainable Management by SWOT and AHP
   Methods
SO WATER
AB The sustainable management of river basins is a comprehensive problem involving not only environmental quality but also socio-economic aspects. The primary objective of the study is to propose a sustainable management model of a river basin based on a clear identification of the good water quality in the river basin applicable for any river basin. The proposal is based on a monitoring of the quality of surface water in the basin, a quantitative and qualitative analysis of pollution, a questionnaire survey on the sewer systems and wastewater treatment in the basin and the diffuse sources of water pollution. For a better outline, a case study of Hornad river basin, Slovakia, was carried out. Two methodologies were applied: SWOT analysis for identification of indicators and the priorities and AHP analysis for a prioritization of the decisions. These analyses can be carried out for any activity based on identification of indicators and the priorities of the defined indicators to promote sustainable development. Based on the findings and the results of the analyses the model for managing the development of surface water quality in the basin was proposed. Generally applicable principles of sustainable development, accepting legislation in the field of water management, considering the quality of surface water in the basin, the impacts of wastewater discharges into the recipient, the identification and evaluation of positive and negative aspects of surface water quality, and the implementation of the proposed measures and post-implementation monitoring of qualitative development were covered in and by the proposed model.

TI Dry Climate Aggravates Riverine Nitrogen Pollution in Australia by Water
   Volume Reduction
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Freshwater is a scarce resource, and maintaining water quality is of great importance in dryland Australia. How water quality is affected by the dry climate and socio-economic influences in Australia remains widely unknown. Here, we find that agriculture activity dominates reactive nitrogen (N-r) emissions to water bodies. Such emissions not only contribute to deteriorating water quality in Southeastern Australia but also harm marine ecosystems, including the Great Barrier Reef, a World Natural Heritage site. A dry and warm climate reduces the share of N-r emitted directly to water bodies; however, it increases the N-r concentration in surface water due to reduced water volume, leading to a 3-fold higher water N-r concentration compared to major rivers globally, e.g., in the US or China. Business-as-usual socioeconomic development would increase the total N-r emitted to surface water by at least 43% by 2050, while effective mitigation measures could reduce N runoff by about 27%. Advanced agricultural management strategies should be considered to reduce future environmental pressures due to N runoff in Australia.

TI Occurrence, distribution, and risk assessment of antibiotics in the
   Songhua River in China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The occurrence, distribution, and risk assessment of antibiotics in freshwater systems are receiving global attention, because of their impact on the environment and human health. However, few studies have focused on this topic in Northeast China and its Songhua River, the third-largest river in China. This study investigated the occurrence and distribution of 12 antibiotics, including three cephalosporins (cefazolin, cefmetazole, cefotaxime), three macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin), three fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, norfloxacin, flumequine), and three sulfonamides (sulfadiazine, sulfapyridine, sulfamethoxazole) in the mainstream and tributaries of the Songhua River. A total of 152 surface water samples were collected in January, May, July, and October 2016. These samples were analyzed using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The results indicated the wide use of all 12 antibiotics in the mainstream of the Songhua River. Sulfamethoxazole and cefazolin were the dominant antibiotics, with maximum concentrations of 73.1 and 65.4 ng L-1, respectively. Other antibiotics were present at mean concentrations below 15 ng L-1, except cefmetazole, present at a mean concentration of 35.6 ng L-1. The spatial distribution of antibiotics showed that unbalanced regional development may lead to the distribution pattern of the antibiotics in the tributaries and the mainstream. Thus study also assessed the seasonal variation of antibiotics in urban surface water; cephalosporin, sulfonamide, fluoroquinolone, and macrolide concentrations were significantly higher during the icebound season than during non-icebound season. This may be due to the low temperature and water flow of the river in winter. Risk assessment showed that azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, flumequine, and sulfamethoxazole posed a low or median risk to the aquatic organisms in the mainstream. The potential risks created by antibiotics to the aquatic environment should not be neglected in the Songhua River. The potential risks created by antibiotics to the aquatic environment should not be neglected in the Songhua River.

TI A review of water pollution arising from agriculture and mining
   activities in Central Asia: Facts, causes and effects
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Central Asia is one of many regions worldwide that face severe water shortages; nevertheless, water pollution in this region exacerbates the existing water stress and increases the risk of regional water conflicts. In this study, we perform an extensive literature review, and the data show that water pollution in Central Asia is closely linked to human activities. Within the Asian Gold Belt, water pollution is influenced mainly by mining, and the predominant pollutants are heavy metals and radionuclides. However, in the irrigated areas along the middle and lower reaches of inland rivers (e.g., the Amu Darya and Syr Darya), water pollution is strongly associated with agriculture. Hence, irrigated areas are characterized by high concentrations of ammonia, nitrogen, and phosphorus. In addition, the salinities of rivers and groundwater in the middle and lower reaches of inland rivers generally increase along the flow path due to high rates of evaporation. Soil salinization and frequent salt dust storms in the Aral Sea basin further increase the pollution of surface water bodies. Ultimately, the pollution of surface water and groundwater poses risks to human health and deteriorates the ecological environment. To prevent further water pollution, joint monitoring of the surface water and groundwater quantity and quality throughout Central Asia must be implemented immediately.

TI Cellular automata based framework for evaluating mitigation strategies
   of sponge city
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Urban surface water flooding is increasing because of climate change and urbanization, and brings great challenges to urban sustainable development. It is, therefore, most important to develop urban flood management approaches to alleviate the consequences of floods. China is implementing a "sponge city" initiative to tackle urban surface water flooding and improve urban water management. There is, however, limited cost-effectiveness evaluation to support the choice of economically efficient mitigation strategies. To address this gap, this study developed an evaluation framework based on cellular automata and cost-benefit analysis to assess the performance of mitigation strategies in sponge city construction. This approach is demonstrated with a case study of Siergou (Dalian, China), which has a total area of 10.1 km(2). The mitigation measures of green roofs, permeable pavements and bio-retention were used to generate mitigation scenarios. A two-dimensional cellular automata-based model was used to simulate urban surface water flooding. The results obtained from the case study indicate that the framework can achieve cost-effective mitigation strategies for sponge city construction, which can support robust decision making. The distribution of mitigation strategies has great impacts on the effectiveness of alleviating urban flood risk This study provides new insight into the development of cost-effective mitigation strategies for sponge city construction.

TI Contextualizing Schistosoma haematobium transmission in Ghana:
   Assessment of diagnostic techniques and individual and community
   water-related risk factors
SO ACTA TROPICA
AB Objectives: The study assessed associations between Schistosoma haematobium infection (presence of parasite eggs in urine or hematuria) and self-reported metrics (macrohematuria, fetching surface water, or swimming) to evaluate their performance as proxies of infection in presence of regular preventive chemotherapy. It also examined community water characteristics (safe water access, surface water access, and groundwater quality) to provide context for schistosomiasis transmission in different types of communities and propose interventions.
   Methods: Logistic regression was used to assess the associations between the various measured and self-reported metrics in a sample of 897 primary school children in 30 rural Ghanaian communities. Logistic regression was also used to assess associations between community water characteristics, self-reported water-related behaviors and S. haematobium infection. Communities were subsequently categorized as candidates for three types of interventions: provision of additional safe water sources, provision of groundwater treatment, and health education about water-related disease risk, depending on their water profile.
   Results: Microhematuria presence measured with a reagent strip was a good proxy of eggs in urine at individual (Kendall's tau(b) = 0.88, p < 0.001) and at school-aggregated (Spearman's r(s) = 0.96, p < 0.001) levels. Self-reported macrohematuria and swimming were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with egg presence, but self reported fetching was not. Of the community water characteristics, greater surface water access and presence of groundwater quality problems were significantly associated with increased likelihood of fetching, swimming, and S. haematobium infection. Access to improved water sources did not exhibit an association with any of these outcomes.
   Conclusions: The study illustrates that in presence of regular school-based treatment with praziquantel, microhematuria assessed via reagent strips remains an adequate proxy for S. haematobium infection in primary schoolchildren. Community water profiles, in combination with self-reported water-related behaviors, can help elucidate reasons for some endemic communities continuing to experience ongoing transmission and tailor interventions to these local contexts to achieve sustainable control.

TI Evaluation of aluminum speciation in surface waters in China and its
   environmental risk assessment
SO ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY
AB As the ongoing global research on acid precipitation is developing in depth, more and more attention has been paid to the ecological effects of aluminum (Al) due to its toxicity to plants and animals, which is caused by acid precipitation. As a very serious problem of terrestrial and aquatic environmental acidification occurs in China, especially in southwestern China, a systematic investigation of Al speciation in these regions is very important. In this paper, the Al speciation results of surface waters in China are reported and its ecological impacts is evaluated. More than 100 water samples were collected from about twenty provinces of China. Driscoll's Al speciation scheme combined with the modified MINQEL computer model is used for speciation of Al. This study shows that the ecological impacts of acidification are quite different between China and Western countries, because of different geographical environments and geological settings. In Western countries, acidification is mainly caused by NO2-. Due to low concentrations of K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, the buffer capacities of soil and water are weak. Therefore, natural waters can be acidified to pH<5 very easily, resulting in a considerable mobilization of Al and worsening of the ecological environment. In China, acid precipitation is mainly in the form of sulfuric acid. In northwestern China, concentrations of K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+ are high in soil and surface waters. This leads to much higher capacity and a high resistance ability to acidification. The pH values of waters in this region are high (around 7) and no serious Al toxicity is found at present. However, in northeastern and southeastern China, the soil is rich in Al (unsaturated aluminosilicates in northeastern China, saturated aluminosilicates in north and central China, aluminum-rich soil in southeastern and southwestern China). The concentrations of K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+ in soil and waters are lower than those of northwestern China. Therefore the buffer capacity is limited. Numerous surface waters have already been acidified and pH values declined to 5. The impacts of Al toxicity on ecological systems in these regions are very serious, especially in Jiangxi, Hubei Provinces and Chongqing Municipality.

TI Global evaluation of heavy metal content in surface water bodies: A
   meta-analysis using heavy metal pollution indices and multivariate
   statistical analyses
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Water is polluted by increasing activities of population and the necessity to provide them with goods and services that use water as a vital resource. The contamination of water due to heavy metals (HMs) is a big concern for humankind; however, global studies related to this topic are scarce. Thus, the current review assesses the content of HMs in surface water bodies throughout the world from 1994 to 2019. To achieve this goal, multivariate analyses were applied in order to determine the possible sources of HMs. Among the analyzed HMs in a total of 147 publications, the average content of Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, As and Cd exceeded the permissible limits suggested by WHO and USEPA. The results of the heavy metal pollution index, evaluation index, the degree of contamination, water pollution and toxicity load showed that the examined water bodies are highly polluted by HMs. The results of median lethal toxicity index showed maximum toxicity in As, Co, Cr and Ni in the surface water bodies. Results of ingestion and dermal pathways for adults and children in the current analyzed review showed that As is the major contaminant. Moreover, Cr, Ni, As and Cd showed values that could be considered as a high risk for cancer generation via the ingestion pathway as compared to the dermal route. It is recommended that remediation techniques such as the introduction of aquatic phytoremediation plant species and adsorbents should be included in land management plans in order to reduce human risks.

TI A preliminary study on mercury contamination to the environment from
   artisanal zinc smelting using indigenous methods in Hezhang county,
   Guizhou, China - Part 1: mercury emission from zinc smelting and its
   influences on the surface waters
SO ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
AB Zinc smelting is one of the important anthropogenic atmospheric mercury emission sources, but research on mercury emission from this source category is limited. Using a mass balance method, we estimated the average mercury emission factors from artisanal zinc smelting using indigenous method in Hezhang, Guizhou, China to be 155 and 79 g Hg t(-1) of Zn produced from sulfide ore and oxide ore, respectively. These emission factors are much higher than the literature value used to estimate mercury emission from zinc smelting in developing countries, which is 25g Hg t(-1) of Zn produced. Annual mercury emission rates from artisanal zinc smelting in this area were calculated from 1989 to 2001. Up to 2003, a few metric tons of mercury was annually emitted to the ambient air from zinc smelting in such a small area (< 150 km(2)), posing a threat to the local environment. It highlighted that artisainal zinc smelting in Hezahng was an important global atmospheric mercury emission source. The local surface waters were seriously contaminated with mercury due to zinc smelting. Apart from the deposition of mercury species was that emitted from zinc smelting, smelting residues are also the sources of mercury contamination to surface water systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Determining risk for severe leptospirosis by molecular analysis of
   environmental surface waters for pathogenic Leptospira
SO PLOS MEDICINE
AB Background Although previous data indicate that the overall incidence of human leptospirosis in the Peruvian Amazon is similar in urban and rural sites, severe leptospirosis has been observed only in the urban context. As a potential explanation for this epidemiological observation, we tested the hypothesis that concentrations of more virulent Leptospira would be higher in urban than in rural environmental surface waters.
   Methods and Findings A quantitative real-time PCR assay was used to compare levels of Leptospira in urban and rural environmental surface waters in sites in the Peruvian Amazon region of Iquitos. Molecular taxonomic analysis of a 1,200-bp segment of the leptospiral 16S ribosomal RNA gene was used to identify Leptospira to the species level. Pathogenic Leptospira species were found only in urban slum water sources ( Fisher's exact test; p = 0.013). The concentration of pathogen-related Leptospira was higher in urban than rural water sources (similar to 10(3) leptospires/ml versus 0.5 x 10(2) leptospires/ml; F = 8.406, p < 0.05). Identical 16S rRNA gene sequences from Leptospira interrogans serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae were found in urban slum market area gutter water and in human isolates, suggesting a specific mode of transmission from rats to humans. In a prospective, population- based study of patients presenting with acute febrile illness, isolation of L. interrogans-related leptospires from humans was significantly associated with urban acquisition (75% of urban isolates); human isolates of other leptospiral species were associated with rural acquisition (78% of rural isolates) (chi-square analysis; p < 0.01). This distribution of human leptospiral isolates mirrored the distribution of leptospiral 16S ribosomal gene sequences in urban and rural water sources.
   Conclusions Our findings data support the hypothesis that urban severe leptospirosis in the Peruvian Amazon is associated with higher concentrations of more pathogenic leptospires at sites of exposure and transmission. This combined quantitative and molecular taxonomical risk assessment of environmental surface waters is globally applicable for assessing risk for leptospiral infection and severe disease in leptospirosis-endemic regions.

TI Landsat 8 OLI image based terrestrial water extraction from
   heterogeneous backgrounds using a reflectance homogenization approach
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB Surface waters are fundamental resources for terrestrial life, yet they are not free of both natural and anthropogenic influences at global-scale. An accurate and robust method to extract water bodies is critical to effectively manage these irreplaceable resources. Conventional methods are frequently limited in terms of the uncertainty related to the coarse resolution and regional reflectance heterogeneity of satellite images. The fuzzy clustering method (FCM) considering local spatial information has a proven capability to compensate for these limitations. Nevertheless, this technique is highly sensitive to immense false signals in original satellite images. Therefore, a systematic surface water extraction method by taking advantage of the complementarity between a water index (WI) and a modified FCM (WIMFCM) was designed in this study to improve the water extraction accuracy, the rationale of which is a background reflectance bias correction. Applications were performed to sixteen test sites varying from coasts to inland waters to comprehensively evaluate the reliability of the WIMFCM using the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. Results showed the WIMFCM improved the accuracy of water extraction in comparison to alternative methods in terms of kappa coefficients (KCs) and total classification errors (TEs). Overall, the mean KC of the WIMFCM was 0.94 and its mean TE was 1139%, compared with original WI (KC = 0.89, TE = 19.84%) and a support vector machine (SVM) method (KC = 0.89, TE = 22.39%). In addition, a seasonal analysis revealed the WIMFCM could maintain consistent reliability throughout the year, demonstrating its potential for accurate dynamic water monitoring associated with seasonal water probability mask. Additional tests using Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data revealed the WIMFCM could be extended to large-scale regions, as well as be used in near-real time surface water body extraction. The findings of this study offer a new method to improve target detection accuracy under reflectance heterogeneous environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI ENERGETIC, HYDRAULIC AND ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY OF AXIAL FLOW AND
   CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS FOR SURFACE WATER IRRIGATION IN BANGLADESH
SO IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
AB With conventional centrifugal (CEN) pumps, less than 50% of southern Bangladesh's farmers invest in irrigation, partly due to high diesel energy costs. New policies are prioritizing sustainable crop intensification in Bangladesh's delta. This objective is unlikely to be achieved without fundamental changes in the energetics and economics of irrigation. Where surface water is available, axial flow pumps (AFPs) may comprise part of the solution to this problem. Comparing the hydraulic, energetic and economic performance of prototype AFPs and CEN pumps, the latter produced less yet consistent rates of discharge than AFPs at all heads. AFP discharge was conversely larger than CEN pumps, but inversely related to increasing head. Discharge per unit of fuel was highest for AFPs (+51 and +21% at 1-and 2-m lifts), but declined with rising head until convergence with CEN pumps at 2.8m. High AFP discharge reduced irrigation time requirements. On average, AFPs can save between US$ 70 and 38 ha(-1) season(-1) for boro rice at 1-and 3-m heads, respectively, and between US$ 15 and 8, and 26 and 14 ha-1 season-1 for wheat and maize. Fuel efficiency reductions above 2.8 m highlight the importance of improved prototyping and technology targeting to ensure AFP deployment in environments where the greatest efficiency gains are achievable.

AB Water needs to be protected and used in a sustainable way as water demand is extremely increasing. In per capita terms, Sri Lanka is well above the national water scarcity threshold of 1,700m(3)/person suggested by Falkenmark et al (1989). However at the local scale, already three districts are within the national water scarcity threshold as the Srilankan surface water availability varies significantly across 103 distinct river basins and four rainfall seasons. Many drivers including demographic pattern, economic growth and consumption pattern contribute to an increase and vary spatial and temporal water demand, have changed significantly since the early 1990s. Further, recent inconsistency of seasonal monsoon weather patterns has a major influence on surface water management system in the Sri Lanka. The present study aim is to analyze the changes in inter-annual and intra-annual spatial and temporal variation of surface water flow in the Sri Lanka to understand the surface water flow variation under the past climatic change. In this study, changes in annual and seasonal mean precipitation, maximum temperature and minimum temperature were analyzed between two time slices at 9 principle meteorological stations representing different climatic zones. The spatial characteristic of the study area is described by three base maps, i.e. land use, elevation and soil. Daily potential evapotranspiration was calculated by Hargreaves Equation and daily rainfall and evapotranspiration spatial maps were developed by inverse distance weighted interpolation method. Spatially distributed hydrological model was calibrated and validated for four different discharge gauge stations in four basins representing different climatic zones and soil types. Surface runoff for two different time slices was simulated for whole country using a validated model with different parameters to relevant basins. Further, Six basins were selected by representing different climatic zones to analyze the temporal variability of surface runoff. The results confirm that the annual mean minimum temperature has increased at most stations while maximum temperature has decreased at stations located in the wet zone. Seasonal mean maximum temperature shows the increase trend in the dry zone during southwest monsoon. Intra-annual runoff changes in basins completely located in dry zone are higher and mainly its' runoff is limited to 2nd inter and northeast monsoons. Basins located in the west and east show significant increase in mean annual runoff volume due to precipitation increase in the southwest monsoon to the west and northeast monsoon to east. However river basins located in northwest show general decrease in mean annual runoff volume as inter monsoon precipitation gets reduced. It was confirmed that past climate change is significant in spatial and temporal variation of runoff over the country.

TI Towards harmonization of water quality management: A comparison of
   chemical drinking water and surface water quality standards around the
   globe
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Water quality standards (WQS) set the legal definition for safe and desirable water. WQS impose regulatory concentration limits to act as a jurisdiction-specific legislative risk-management tool. Despite its importance in shaping a universal definition of safe, clean water, little information exists with respect to (dis)similarity of chemical WQS worldwide. Therefore, this paper compares chemical WQS for drinking and surface water matrices in eight jurisdictions representing a global geographic distribution: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, the region of Flanders in Belgium, the United States of America, and South Africa. The World Health Organization's list is used as a reference for drinking water standards. Sorensen-Dice indices (SDI) showed little qualitative similarity in the compounds that are regulated in drinking water (median SDI = 40%) and surface water (median SDI = 33%), indicating that the heterogeneity within a matrix is substantial at the level of the standard. Quantitative similarity for matching standards was higher than the qualitative per Kendall correlation (median = 0.73 and 0.58 for drinking water and surface water respectively), yet variance observed within standards remained inexplicably high for organic compounds. Variations in WQS were more pronounced for organic compounds. Most differences cannot be easily explained from a toxicological or risk-based point-of-view. Historical development, ease of measurement, and (toxicological) knowledge gaps on the risk of a vast number of organic compounds are theorized to be the drivers. Therefore, this study argues for a more tailored, risk-based approach in which standards incorporated into water safety plans are dynamically set for compounds that are persistent and could pose a risk for human health and/or aquatic ecosystems. Global variations in WQS should therefore not necessarily be avoided but rather globally harmonized with enough flexibility to ensure a global, up-to-date definition of safe and desirable water everywhere.

TI Multiple pesticides occurrence, fate, and environmental risk assessment
   in a small horticultural stream of Argentina
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Peri-urban horticulture is crucial to local populations, but a global paucity of information exists regarding the contamination of the associated waterways because of this activity. The aim of this study was to assess pesticide pollution of surface water, suspended particulate matter and bottom sediments from the Carnaval Creek Basin (La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina) - a representative system of waterways surrounded by horticultural production - by over 40 selected herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides by gas-chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Six sampling campaigns were conducted biannually from 2015 to 2017. Glyphosate and (aminomethyl)phosphonic acid (AMPA), surpris-ingly, were the most frequently detected pesticides, in concentrations comparable to those reported in areas with genetically modified extensive crops (maximum in water, 20.04 and 4.86 mu g.L-1; in sediment, 1146.5 and 4032.7 mu g.L-1, respectively). The insecticides chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin were detected in more than 30% of the samples. The concentrations tended to greatly exceed those previously reported - by up to more than 800 times for chlorpyrifos in water (maximum 2.645 mu g.L-1) and more than 400 times for lambda-cyhalothrin in sediments (maximum 2607.7 mu g.kg(dw)(-1)). The total pesticide concentration in surface water was found to be influenced by precipitation regimes but was independent of the season of the year, with precipitations of more than 140 mm diluting the pesticide concentrations to levels below detection limits. An environmental risk assessment performed with the pesticide concentrations of pesticides in surface water revealed that the surrounding horticultural activity posed a high risk for aquatic biota, with 30% of the samples exceeding the threshold value by more than a thousand times. We conclude that pesticides from horticultural use are a major threat to small streams and their biodiversity. This work provides valuable information that is scarce regarding the impact on watercourses exclusively as a consequence of horticulture. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Phytoremediation provides a low cost and sustainable remediation to eliminate the contaminants in water particularly heavy metals. Some plants have the ability to absorb certain metals while some plants do not. This research investigates the potential of different green plants to absorb copper (Cu) in three types of water; distilled, mineral and surface water. A green plant scientifically named as Limnocharis Flava plant were found to be effective in absorbing the Cu contaminants. The rate of absorption of Cu for different plants and water types were determined and monitored in fume cupboard equipped with tungsten bulb under controlled environment; light intensity, humidity, temperature and concentration of CuSO4. In just 5 days of experiment, the highest rate of absorption of Cu was observed in distilled water where the efficiency was 39.9%. Meanwhile, the absorption efficiency of copper in surface water and mineral water samples were 31.5% and 23.6% respectively. The absorption of Cu in different types of water fitted the 1st order, Rate Law model with >90% coefficient of determination. Other plant named Hydrilla Verticillata were studied using the same metal contaminant and conditions resulted with no observable Cu absorption. The concentration of Cu in the water samples throughout the research were analyzed at 324.8 nm wavelength using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Using hydrochemical, stable isotope, and river water recharge data to
   identify groundwater flow paths in a deeply buried karst system
SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
AB The deeply buried river-connected Xishan karst aquifer (XKA) in western Beijing, China, has been suffering from diminishing recharge for several decades, which in turn leads to the disappearing of spring water outflows and continuously lowering of groundwater level in the area. Thus, it is important to correctly recognize the groundwater recharge and flow paths for the sustainable development of the XKA. To investigate these issues, the hydrochemical and isotopic compositions are analysed for both surface water and groundwater samples collected over an area of about 280km(2). Results show that (a) the river water is characterized by high Na contents; (b) the H-2 and O-18 values in the river water are distinctively higher than those of groundwater samples, after experiencing the long-time evaporative enrichment in the upstream reservoir; (c) the Sr concentrations and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of groundwater clearly indicated the interaction between water and carbonate minerals but excluded the water-silicate interaction; and (d) the groundwater samples in the direct recharge area of the XKA have the lowest Na concentrations and the H-2 and O-18 values. Based on the large differences in the Na contents and O-18 values of groundwater and surface water, a simple two-component mixing model is developed for the study area and the fractions of the river water are estimated for groundwater samples. We find that the distribution pattern of the river water fractions in the XKA clearly shows a change of directions in the preferential flow path of the groundwater from its source zone to the discharge area. Overall, our results suggest that the recharged surface water can be a useful evidence for delineating the groundwater flow path in river-connected karst aquifer. This study improves our understanding of the heterogeneity in karst groundwater systems.

TI Global Corrections to Reference Irradiance Spectra for Non-Clear-Sky
   Conditions
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Photochemical reactions in surface waters play important roles in element cycling and in the removal of organic contaminants, among other processes. A central environmental variable affecting photochemical processes in surface waters is the incoming solar irradiance, as this initiates these processes. However, clear-sky incident irradiance spectra are often used when evaluating the fate of aquatic contaminants, leading to an overestimation of contaminant decay rates due to photochemical transformation. In this work, incident irradiance satellite data were used to develop global-scale non-clear-sky correction factors for commonly used reference irradiance spectra. Non-clear-sky conditions can decrease incident irradiance by over 90% depending on the geographic location and time of the year, with latitudes above 40 degrees N being most heavily affected by seasons. The impact of non-clear-sky conditions on contaminant half-lives was illustrated in a case study of triclosan in lake Greifensee, which showed a 39% increase in the triclosan half-life over the course of a year under non-clear-sky conditions. A global annual average correction factor of 0.76 was determined as an approximate way to account for non-clear-sky conditions. The correction factors are developed at monthly and seasonal resolutions for every location on the globe between 70 degrees N and 60 degrees S at a 4 km spatial resolution and can be used by researchers, practitioners, and regulators who need improved estimates of incident irradiance.

TI Hydroclimatic trends in the Mississippi River basin from 1948 to 2004
SO JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
AB The trends of the surface water and energy budget components in the Mississippi River basin from 1948 to 2004 are investigated using a combination of hydrometeorological observations and observation-constrained simulations of the land surface conditions using the latest version of the Community Land Model version 3 (CLM3). The atmospheric forcing data for the CLM3 were constructed by adding the intramonthly variations from the 6-hourly National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis to observation-based analyses of monthly precipitation, surface air temperature, and cloud cover. The model-based analysis suggests that, for the surface water budget, the observed increase in basin-averaged precipitation is compensated by increases in both runoff and evapotranspiration. For the surface energy budget, the decrease of net shortwave radiation associated with observed increases in cloudiness is compensated by decreases in both net longwave radiation and sensible heat flux, while the latent heat flux increases in association with wetter soil conditions. Both the simulated surface water and energy budgets support the view that evapotranspiration has increased in the Mississippi River basin from 1948 to 2004. Sensitivity experiments show that the precipitation change dominates the evapotranspiration trend, while the temperature and solar radiation changes have only small effects. Large spatial variations within the Mississippi River basin and the contiguous United States are also found. However, the increased evapotranspiration is ubiquitous despite spatial variations in hydrometeorology.

TI How much do human and livestock actually contribute to steroids emission
   and surface water pollution from past to the future: A global research
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB A comprehensive global inventory of past, present, and future steroid emissions was firstly developed based on the global 5' x 5' grids relevant data available. From 1970 to 2070, the growth rate of the annual global steroid emission was relatively stable around 10%. At present (in 2015), the global steroid emissions was 18270 t, with 17% contributed by humans. Almost one-third of total animal emissions have been occurring in India and Brazil. India also had the highest value of human steroid emissions. Regions with highest steroid emissions were concentrated between 10 degrees similar to 35 degrees N and 70 degrees similar to 90 degrees E. The increase of sewage treatment rates can effectively reduce the total quantity of steroids entering the environment, especially for some developing countries. But the "technology bonus" from sewage treatment process will be exhausted until to 2030. Meanwhile, global surface water pollution was predicted based on steroid emissions into water compartment and on the digital river network with annual river discharge. The modelling results show that steroids are widely distributed across the globe, with concentrations mostly below 100 ng/L. However, if no proper treatment measures for animal excretions, in another 100 years, the range of the surface water contaminated by steroids will increase by 12 times. The Nile River resulted as the most polluted among the eight world's longest and famous rivers during the whole period investigated. Various measured concentrations worldwide validated our modelling result. The global steroid emission inventory and surface water pollution from past to the future will stand as an important data and knowledge base for the management of pollution from different types of steroids at global and regional level.

AB The Czech Republic does not have a substantial source of surface water within its territorial catchment areas. Czech surface water is essentially divided and transported into the three seas in the European continent. This unchanging reality must permanently influence the Czech Republic's water policy and principles of land use. Under new climatic conditions, water management must, among other things, consider wider international cooperation on water management within the European Union countries and agricultural land management. The aim of this paper is to characterize changes in water use and international solutions to water management issues that all are essential both for water management and the preservation of basic living conditions. The short-term failure of management solutions not only will increase the risk of water scarcity within the Czech Republic during the 21 st century but at the same time may, in certain situations, cause many problems in water management and subsequently in the agricultural sector in the form of surface water and groundwater deficiency and restrictions on the cultivation of traditional agricultural crops. The topic is further elaborated based on analysis, synthesis methods, expert reflection and literary research.

TI Spatial and seasonal variations of endocrine disrupting compounds in
   water and sediment samples of Markman Canal and Swartkops River Estuary,
   South Africa and their ecological risk assessment
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB The presence of pharmaceuticals in surface water and sediment has sparked up a global concern, as they could cause harm to human health. In this study, we investigated five pharmaceuticals (caffeine, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, testosterone, and trimethoprim) in surface water and sediment samples from Swartkops River Estuary and Markman Stormwater Canal, in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) systems coupled with a hyphenated quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS) was used for the analysis. Of the five pharmaceuticals investigated, three were detected in sediment samples at concentrations ranging from BDL - 23.86 mu g/kg (dw). Caffeine and sulfamethoxazole were below the detection limit. The finding of this current study suggests that Markman and Motherwell's stormwater canals were potential contributors to pollution in Swartkops River Estuary. Ecotoxicity risk assessment indicated that trimethoprim and carbamazepine could constitute potential risk to aquatic organisms in Markman Canal and Swartkops Estuary, suggesting the need for proper control measure to prevent the pollution from toxicants in aquatic resources.

TI THE IMPLICATIONS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, CLIMATE CHANGE AND EUROPEAN
   WATER POLICY ON SURFACE WATER QUALITY THREATS
SO ACTA SCIENTIARUM POLONORUM-FORMATIO CIRCUMIECTUS
AB The paper presents historical background, up-to-date situation and future perspectives for the development of nutrient pollution threats to European surface water quality, as well as the evolution of the approach to water pollution. Utilized agricultural area in European countries is slightly diminishing, however the consumption of mineral fertilisers is steadily increasing. The consumption in Europe in the years 2015-2030 is projected to increase by 10%, and in the world by 20%. Both climate changes leading to the increase of temperature even of ca. 6 degrees C (in comparison to the pre-industrial period) and accelerated soil erosion due to high intensity rainfall cause increased productivity of water ecosystems. Those aspects have to be taken into consideration in water management. Due to legal regulations introduced in the last twenty years, wastewater treatment has been made more effective and population connected to wastewater treatment systems has increased. The improvement has been seen mainly in eastern and southern parts of Europe. After the implementation of Water Framework Directive theories regarding modem water management have been developed, with the aim to increase the ecosystem's capacity and its resilience to climate changes and anthropopressure.

TI Evaluation of power generation operations in response to changes in
   surface water reservoir storage
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB We used a customized, river basin-based model of surface water rights to evaluate the response of power plants to drought via simulated changes in reservoir storage. Our methodology models surface water rights in 11 river basins in Texas using five cases: (1) storage decrease of existing capacity of 10%, (2) storage decrease of 50%, (3) complete elimination of storage, (4) storage increase of 10% (all at existing locations), and (5) construction of new reservoirs (at new locations) with a total increase in baseline reservoir capacity for power plant cooling of 9%. Using the Brazos River basin as a sample, we evaluated power generation operations in terms of reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability. As simulated water storage decreases, reliability generally decreases and resiliency and vulnerability remain relatively constant. All three metrics remain relatively constant with increasing reservoir storage, with the exception of one power plant. As reservoir storage changes at power plants, other water users in the basin are also affected. In general, decreasing water storage is beneficial to other water users in the basin, and increasing storage is detrimental for many other users. Our analysis reveals basin-wide and individual power plant-level impacts of changing reservoir storage, demonstrating a methodology for evaluation of the sustainability and feasibility of constructing new reservoir storage as a water and energy management approach.

TI Occurrence, bioaccumulation and toxicological effect of drugs of abuse
   in aquatic ecosystem: A review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Drugs of abuse are a group of emerging contaminants. As the prevalence of manufacture and consumption, there is a growing global environmental burden and ecological risk from the continuous release of these contaminants into environment. The widespread occurrence of drugs of abuse in waste wasters and surface waters is due to the incomplete removal through traditional wastewater treatment plants in different regions around the world. Although their environmental concentrations are not very high, they can potentially influence the aquatic organisms and ecosystem function. This paper reviews the occurrence of drugs of abuse and their metabolites in waste waters and surface waters, their bioaccumulation in aquatic plants, fishes and benthic organisms and even top predators, and the toxicological effects such as genotoxic effect, cytotoxic effect and even behavioral effect on aquatic organisms. In summary, drugs of abuse occur widely in aquatic environment, and may exert adverse impact on aquatic organisms at molecular, cellular or individual level, and even on aquatic ecosystem. It necessitates the monitoring and risk assessment of these compounds on diverse aquatic organisms in the further study.

TI Characteristics and source-pathway of microplastics in freshwater system
   of China: A review
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB China plays a key role in global plastic production, consumption and disposal, which arouses growing concern about microplastics (MPs) contamination in Chinese freshwater systems. However, few reviews have discussed the characteristics of MP pollution in whole freshwater systems at a national scale. In this review, we summarized the characteristics, sources and transport pathways of MPs in Chinese freshwater systems including surface water and sediment. Results showed that current research mainly focused on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and its tributaries, as well as lakes and reservoirs along the Yangtze River. Large-scale reservoirs, rivers and lakes located in densely populated areas usually showed higher abundances of MPs. The majority of MPs in Chinese surface water and sediment mainly consisted of polyethylene and polypropylene, and the most common morphologies were fibers and fragments. To identify the sources and pathways, we introduced the source-sink-pathway model, and found that sewage system, farmland and aquaculture area were the three most prevalent sinks in freshwater systems in China. The source-sink-pathway model will help to further identify the migration of MPs from sources to freshwater systems.

TI An enhanced risk assessment framework for microplastics occurring in the
   Westerscheldt estuary
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Microplastics (MPs) pollution in the aquatic environment raises considerable concerns. Freshwater system is generally considered as an important source for MPs transformation into the marine environment, however, only limited data on the MPs pollution in global freshwater systems is available at this time. In this study, we explored the abundance, characteristics and distribution of microplastics in the Scheldt River. The investigation results indicated that the abundance of microplastics in sediments (15-413 items/kg dry weight (DW)) was much higher than that in surface water (0-113 items/m(3)), and small size MPs (less than 500 mu m) frequently appeared in sediments. Industrial activities were regarded as the major cause of MP discharging. Risk assessment models with using data of the concentration of MPs, polymer types and toxicity of MPs exposure were developed to assess the risk of MPs pollution in both surface water and sediment of the Westerscheldt estuary. Risk assessment results revealed that MPs exposure have potentially adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystem and human health. MPs tend to be transported from "Hotspots", such as urban or industries area, to remote areas. The risk assessment of MPs serves as a baseline for better understanding the distribution and characteristics of MPs and highlights the need of intensively monitoring to limit MPs release by intensively monitoring. This research provides a perspective on the risk of MPs that could be used in future studies.

TI Theory, tools, and multidisciplinary applications for tracing
   groundwater fluxes from temperature profiles
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER
AB Quantifying groundwater fluxes to and from deep aquifers or shallow sediment is a critical task faced by researchers and practitioners from many environmental science disciplines including hydrology, hydrogeology, ecology, climatology, and oceanography. Groundwater discharge to inland and coastal water bodies influences their water budgets, thermal regimes, and biogeochemistry. Conversely, downward water flow from the land surface or from surface water bodies to underlying aquifers represents an important water flux that must be quantified for sustainable groundwater management. Because these vertical subsurface flows are slow and typically diffuse, they cannot be measured directly and must rather be estimated using groundwater tracers. Heat is a naturally occurring groundwater tracer that is ubiquitous in the subsurface and readily measured. Most of the academic literature has focused on groundwater temperature tracing methods capitalizing on the propagation of diel temperature sine waves into sediment beneath surface water bodies. Such methods rely on temperature-time series to infer groundwater fluxes and are typically only viable in the shallow subsurface and in locations with focused groundwater fluxes. Alternative methods that utilize temperature-depth profiles are applicable across a broader range of hydrologic environments, and point-in-time measurements can be quickly taken to cover larger spatial scales. Applications of these methods have been impeded due in part to the lack of understanding regarding their potential applications and limitations. Herein, we highlight relevant theory, thermal data collection techniques, and recent diverse field applications to stimulate further multidisciplinary uptake of thermal groundwater tracing methods that rely on temperature-depth profiles.

TI Spatial distribution and influencing factors on urban land surface
   temperature of twelve megacities in China from 2000 to 2017
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB China witnessed a rapid urbanization progress in the past 20 years. Urbanization can greatly influence urban environment, especially thermal environment. Causes for urban heat island (UHI) formation vary in different climatic regions. Understanding characteristics of spatial distribution of urban land surface temperature (ULST) and influencing factors of UHI formation is important for sustainable urban development. In this study, twelve megalopolises in China, each with a population over 5 million, were selected as research sites. Built-up areas and ULST of these megalopolises were extracted from remote sensing data of earth observation satellites of Landsat program for the three periods of 2000?2017. Spatial variation characteristics of ULST were analyzed. Influences of soil moisture, surface water availability, surface albedo, vegetation, energy consumption, gross domestic product, latitudes, precipitation, topography, and distance to the downtown on ULST were investigated through multivariate regression analysis. Results show that: all the cities expanded continuously from 2000 to 2017, but expansion rates varied significantly among the megalopolises. Urban expansion has significant effects on the spatial distribution of ULST. ULST changes more quickly when the expanded area and expansion rate are higher. Simultaneously, spatial distribution of ULST was found to relate to the shape of an urban boundary. Circularly expanding cities showed the most concentrated distribution of high-temperature regions. Correlation analysis revealed that surface water use, evapotranspiration, electric energy consumption, surface albedo, and vegetation activity were the primary influencing factors on ULST, while GDP, latitude, distance, and precipitation had no significant effects on ULST. Among the primary influencing factors, surface water was the main controlling factor on ULST in cities with more surface water distribution. Building area played a more important role in ULST in cities with less surface water distribution. In addition, vegetation area played a relatively more important role in ULST in semi-humid cities than humid cities.

TI Occurrence, distribution, and sources of antimicrobials in a mixed-use
   watershed
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The release into the environment of antimicrobial compounds from both human and agricultural sources is a growing global concern. The Grand River watershed, the largest mixed-use watershed in southern Ontario, receives runoff from intensive animal production as well as municipal wastewater effluents from a rapidly increasing human population. A survey of surface waters and wastewater effluents was conducted across the watershed to assess the occurrence and distribution of several antimicrobials (i.e., trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine, lincomycin, and monensin) and chemical indicators (i.e., ammonia, nitrate, ibuprofen, venlafaxine, atrazine) and to characterize exposure levels. The human antimicrobials trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole were detected in the urban areas of the main channel at mean concentrations of 8 +/- 7 ng/L and 31 +/- 24 ng/L, respectively, but at much lower concentrations in the agricultural tributaries. In contrast, the veterinary antimicrobial sulfamethazine was detected at a mean concentration of 11 +/- 9 ng/L in the main channel, and at a much higher concentration in the agricultural tributaries. Lincomycin was detected in only two river samples and not in the effluents while monensin was not detected in all samples. The herbicide atrazine was detected at very low concentrations in the surface waters of both the tributaries and the main channel. The concentrations of the antimicrobials and chemical indicators generally increased downstream of the confluences with agricultural tributaries and effluent outfalls. In the wastewater effluents, the concentrations of trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, ibuprofen, and venlafaxine decreased with increasing treatment levels (i.e., secondary to tertiary) as indicated by ammonia/nitrate concentrations. There was a strong correlation among trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and venlafaxine in the main channel and in the wastewater effluents. While the environmental concentrations of antimicrobials in the watershed are low relative to toxicity thresholds, their persistence in the environment may be an important consideration in defining strategies for future water management.

TI Fully integrated numerical simulation of surface water-groundwater
   interactions using SWAT-MODFLOW with an improved calibration tool
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
AB Long-term sustainable water resources management requires comprehensive assessment of all water cycle components. The combined calibration of surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) parameters is one of the biggest challenges in simulating SW-GW interactions. SWAT-MODFLOW has improved our ability to simulate SW and GW interactions, however there remain challenges associated with (i) understanding what parameters most influence model outputs and (ii) properly calibrating the GW related components of the water cycle (as represented within SWATMODFLOW). In this paper, we applied SWAT-MODFLOW to the 1452 km(2) Shiraz catchment, located in southwestern Iran, for the period 2003-2019. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis (SA) of both SW and GW parameters was conducted to determine what controls runoff and GW level in the study catchment. The SA reveals that the Curve Number (CN2) and GW hydraulic conductivity (K) parameters have the most significant impact on runoff and GW level simulation. This work also presents a "GW Calibrator" (GWCal) tool along with a demonstration of how GWCal improves the performance of SWAT-MODFLOW in the Shiraz catchment as a result of the insights gained from the SA.

TI Monitoring of lake water quality along with trophic gradient using
   landsat data
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Effect of differential trophic states on remote sensing-based monitoring and quantification of surface water quality is an important but understudied context. Landsat ETM+ data-based multiple linear regression models were conducted to quantify dynamics of lake surface water quality along oligotrophic-to-eutrophic gradient and to explore the influence of trophic state on the detection of water quality dynamics by the best multiple linear regression models. The best multiple linear regression models of dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a, Secchi depth, water temperature, and turbidity had R-adj(2) values ranging from 36.2 % in water temperature to 93.1% in dissolved oxygen for eutrophic Yenicaga Lake and from 36.1 % in Secchi depth to 99.7 % in water temperature for oligotrophic Abant Lake. The difference in the trophic state between Lakes Abant and Yenicaga, significantly affected the composition of the nine Landsat ETM+ spectral bands included in the multiple linear regression models as well as the predictive power of the multiple linear regression models. Remote sensing-based monitoring of lake water quality variables appears to be promising in terms of devising adaptive management decisions towards sustainability of water resources.

SE Springer Hydrogeology
AB The paper introduces basic principles of a new Czech technical standard in the field of stormwater management (TNV 75 9011 Sustainable Stormwater Management). It describes the procedure of the selection of the drainage concept, when individual approaches (stormwater infiltration, drainage to the surface waters, drainage by the combined sewer system) have to be subsequently examined as to their admissibility and feasibility. Within the detailed drainage design, focus is put on the hydraulic loading of infiltration devices determining their pollutants removal efficiency and on the stormwater pre-treatment techniques suitable for the removal of individual pollutant categories before infiltration or discharge to the surface waters. The standard gives also an overview of stormwater management structures and devices together with the rules for their technical and hydraulic design, construction, operation and maintenance.

   in the Pampean region of Argentina: evaluation at a watershed scale
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB The Pampean plains in South America are well-known for their livestock and agricultural productivity. The peri-urban watershed of El Pescado Creek (Central-Eastern Argentina) has been significantly modified in the last few years due to local land-use changes. This work aims to analyze the dynamics of nutrient content associated with the surface water-groundwater relationship in this watershed and to define the trophic state of the watercourse. Sampling sites were selected for both surface water and groundwater analyses, and field surveys were carried out during the spring and summer of 2017. Handmade shallow groundwater wells were installed along the floodplain of the watercourse. Deep groundwater was analyzed in agricultural and livestock farms. In situ determinations included dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), turbidity, transparency, and temperature measurements. Laboratory analyses included NO3--N, total nitrogen (TN), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total phosphorus (TP), and phytobenthonic and phytoplanktonic chlorophyll-a. Results showed an increase in EC and nutrient concentration in the summer samples (both in surface water and shallow groundwater), along with higher turbidity of the surface water. Water flow was dissimilar between samplings (spring: 1.735 m(3)/s, summer: 0.065 m(3)/s), showing contrasting hydrological scenarios. Low wash-out conditions enhanced phytobenthonic algae biomass growth, turning most of the sites towards a eutrophic state in summer. Our results showed that the dynamics of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in the watershed of El Pescado Creek depend on the hydrodynamic processes of the watershed, the different land-uses, and the chemical characteristics of these compounds. In order to develop sustainable management strategies, further understanding of nutrient concentrations effects, and the factors affecting them, must be done in this area of the Pampean region.

TI Climate Change Effects on Planktonic Bacterial Communities in the Ocean
   - From Structure and Function to Long-term and Large-scale Observations
SO CLIMATE CHANGE AND MICROBIAL ECOLOGY: CURRENT RESEARCH AND FUTURE TRENDS
AB Planktonic bacterial communities of marine environments can be considered to be affected by climate change through a set of direct and indirect effects. As direct effects of climate change, elevated temperature and ambient CO2 levels have to be taken into account. As indirect effects a large spectrum of impacts ranging from increased stratification of surface water, deoxygenation of subsurface water, increased occurrence of extreme weather events, and a changed food chain and nutrient regime resulting in a changed top down and bottom up control for bacterioplankton. All these direct and indirect effects will affect bacterial communities in a multifaceted way. Changes in the bacterial communities due to climate change impacts can be expected on all different taxonomic levels, i.e. from the clonal intraspecies level to the phylum level. The focus of the article will be on the evaluation of bacterioplankton observations over time and space and along climate gradients in the frame of environmental parameters allowing modelling with respect to climate change scenarios. A specific emphasis will be on bacterioplankton analysis based on analysis of samples of the Continuous Plankton Recorder Archive. This sample archive allowed insights into particle associated bacteria of coastal environments over more than the last 60 years. Beside effects of climate change effectors on bacterial growth and community composition, effects of climate change on bacteria-mediated marine biogeochemical cycling and potential hazards by increased abundance of pathogenic bacteria such as Vibrio cholerae will be considered.

TI Impact of persistent rain on microplastics distribution and plastisphere
   community: A field study in the Pearl River, China
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Microplastic contamination is a global problem which has been threatening human health and the environment. There is still a knowledge gap about the effect of persistent rain on microplastics distribution and plastisphere community in fluvial environments. In this study, the abundance and composition of microplastics in the sediment and surface water from the Pearl River was investigated. Thirty polymers (10-500 mu m) were identified from thirty-eight samples collected at ten sites using the newly developed laser direct infrared (LDIR) technique. The average concentrations of microplastics in the sediment and surface water were 1974 particles kg-1 and 290 particles L-1, respectively. Abnormally high concentrations of polyurethanes (PU) were possibly due to particulate pollution from ship antifouling. The persistent rain increased the abundance and diversity of microplastics in the surface water, whereas an opposite trend was observed in the sediment. Sediments could temporarily switch from microplastics sinks to potential sources under the effect of violent hydrodynamic disturbances. Additionally, plastisphere communities and predicted functional profiles indicated significant differences before and after the rain. Our study highlights the important impact of persistent rain on microplastic contamination in the environment.

TI Recovery of Cryptosporidium and Giardia organisms from surface water by
   counter-flow refining microfiltration
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
AB As waterborne parasitic cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis outbreaks continue globally, monitoring of Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia in surface water continues to be challenging. Lack of non-clogging and high-efficiency methods for recovery of C. parvum oocysts and G. lamblia cysts in environmental water strongly limits the sensitivity of detection methods for these protozoan organisms. In this work, the Counter-Flow Micro-Refinery (CFMR) system was developed by employing the novel counter-flow microfiltration principle to enrich (oo)cysts for subsequent analytical purposes. The CFMR system was constructed with multiple counter-flow concentration units that were arranged into two refining levels. By use of different numbers of units, the CFMR offered an adjustable concentration ratio allowing the concentration of 10L and 100L to hundreds of mL with no recirculation processing. With spiked samples, recovery of 81.3% oocysts and 86.2% cysts at a variance of<7% was achieved for concentrations as low as 0.5-100 organisms L-1. The recovery efficiency showed consistent for a wide range of water turbidities as well as different sample volumes. No significant clogging has been observed in the experiments. Moreover, the refining filter was able to enrich and separate oocysts and cysts in water, simultaneously. This work verifies a feasible solution for recovering C. parvum oocysts and G. lamblia cysts in large-volume surface waters. The refining system has potential to be a high-efficiency monitoring tool when combined with proper analytical detection methods.

TI Quantitative evaluation of groundwater and surface water interaction
   characteristics during a dry season
SO WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL
AB The groundwater-surface water interaction (GSI) is one of the key issues for the sustainable management of the ecological environment and agricultural production. This study developed an integrated approach combining hydrochemical data interpretation via multivariate statistics and stable isotope analysis for the quantitative evaluation of the GSI characteristics. Through field hydrogeological investigation and sampling, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) of water chemistry parameters and isotopic tracers have been conducted to identify the areas and properties of GSI across spatial scales. As the geological and hydrogeological conditions in the seasonal frozen area are complex and affected by human activities and winter freezing and thawing, the GSI in the dry season had obvious segmentation, and the GSIs were different on both sides of some reaches. The outcomes of Q-mode HCA and PCA indicated that EC and redox conditions are the main identification factors of hydrochemistry of groundwater and GSI. The results from this study provided insightful information for us to understand the major impact factors of GSI, as well as the water resources distributions.

TI Surface water as a cause of land degradation from dryland salinity
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB Secondary dryland salinity is a global land degradation issue. Drylands are often less developed, less well instrumented and less well understood, requiring us to adapt and impose understanding from different hydro-geomorphological settings that are better instrumented and understood. Conceptual models of secondary dryland salinity, from wet and more hydrologically connected landscapes imposed with adjustments for rainfall and streamflow, have led to the pervasive understanding that land clearing alters water balance in favour of increased infiltration and rising groundwater that bring salts to the surface.
   This paper presents data from an intra-catchment surface flow gauging network run for 6 years and a surface-water-groundwater (SW-GW) interaction site to assess the adequacy of our conceptual understanding of secondary dryland salinity in environments with low gradients and runoff yield. The aim is to (re-)conceptualise pathways of water and salt redistribution in dryland landscapes and to investigate the role that surface water flows and connectivity plays in land degradation from salinity in low-gradient drylands. Based on the long-term end-of-catchment gauge, average annual runoff yield is only 0.14% of rainfall. The internal gauging network that operated from 2007-2012 found pulses of internal water (also mobilising salt) in years when no flow was recorded at the catchment outlet. Data from a surface-water-groundwater interaction site show top-down recharge of surface water early in the water year that transitions to a bottom-up system of discharge later in the water year. This connection provides a mechanism for the vertical diffusion of salts to the surface waters, followed by evapo-concentration and downstream export when depression storage thresholds are exceeded. Intervention in this landscape by constructing a broad-based channel to address these processes resulted in a 25% increase in flow volume and a 20% reduction in salinity by allowing the lower catchment to more effectively support bypassing of the storages in the lower landscape that would otherwise retain water and allow salt to accumulate.
   Results from this study suggest catchment internal redistribution of relatively fresh runoff onto the valley floor is a major contributor to the development of secondary dryland salinity. Seasonally inundated areas are subject to significant transmission losses and drive processes of vertical salt mobility. These surface flow and connectivity processes are not only acting in isolation to cause secondary salinity but are also interacting with groundwater systems responding to land clearing and processes recognised in the more conventional understanding of hillslope recharge and groundwater discharge. The study landscape appears to have three functional hydrological components: upland, hillslope "flow" landscapes that generate fresh runoff; valley floor "fill" landscapes with high transmission losses and poor flow connectivity controlled by the micro-topography that promotes a surface-groundwater connection and salt movement; and the downstream "flood" landscapes, where flows are recorded only when internal storages (fill landscapes) are exceeded. This work highlights the role of surface water processes as a contributor to land degradation by dryland salinity in low-gradient landscapes.

TI Spatial variability in surface-water pCO(2) and gas exchange in the
   world's largest semi-enclosed estuarine system: St. Lawrence Estuary
   (Canada)
SO BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB The incomplete spatial coverage of CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) measurements across estuary types represents a significant knowledge gap in current regional- and global-scale estimates of estuarine CO2 emissions. Given the limited research on CO2 dynamics in large estuaries and bay systems, as well as the sources of error in the calculation of pCO(2) (carbonic acid dissociation constants, organic alkalinity), estimates of air-sea CO2 fluxes in estuaries are subject to large uncertainties. The Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence (EGSL) at the lower limit of the subarctic region in eastern Canada is the world's largest estuarine system, and is characterized by an exceptional richness in environmental diversity. It is among the world's most intensively studied estuaries, yet there are no published data on its surface-water pCO(2) distribution. To fill this data gap, a comprehensive dataset was compiled from direct and indirect measurements of carbonate system parameters in the surface waters of the EGSL during the spring or summer of 2003-2016. The calculated surface-water pCO(2) ranged from 435 to 765 mu atm in the shallow partially mixed upper estuary, 139-578 mu atm in the deep stratified lower estuary, and 207-478 mu atm along the Laurentian Channel in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Overall, at the time of sampling, the St. Lawrence Estuary served as a very weak source of CO2 to the atmosphere, with an area-averaged CO2 degassing flux of 0.98 to 2.02 mmol Cm (-2) d(-1) (0.36 to 0.74 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) ). A preliminary analysis revealed that respiration (upper estuary), photosynthesis (lower estuary), and temperature (Gulf of St. Lawrence) controlled the spatial variability in surface-water pCO(2). Whereas we used the dissociation constants of Cai and Wang (1998) to calculate estuarine pCO(2), formulations recommended for best practices in open ocean environments may underestimate pCO(2) at low salinities, while those of Millero (2010) may result in overestimates.

TI Water quality and health risk assessment of trace elements in surface
   water at Punjnad Headworks, Punjab, Pakistan
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Pollution of the aquatic ecosystem due to different trace elements has become a global concern which has raised health-related issues for both aquatic and human life. Industrial and agricultural water run-off drained into the rivers and deposit trace elements in water, sediments and planktons. This study was designed to calculate the burden of trace elements such as aluminium (Al), arsenic (As), barium (Ba), and lead (Pb) in the river water of Punjnad Headworks, Bahawalpur, Punjab, Pakistan. Samples were collected from surface water, bed sediments and planktons during autumn, winter and spring seasons (September 2018 to May 2019). The results showed that the concentration of Pb was highest in surface water (453.87 mg L-1), while that of Al was highest in sediments (370.24 mu g g(-1)) and plankton (315.05 mu g g(-1)). A significant difference was found in metal concentrations among surface water, bed sediments and plankton at different sampling stations during various seasons. Importantly, the Exp(ing) (0.71, 1.23(-3), 0.34, 0.02 for Pb, As, Al, and Ba, respectively) and Exp(derm) (7.09(-8), 1.23(10), 3.42(-8), and 2.48(-9 )for Pb, As, Al, and Ba, respectively) for trace elements were below 1.0 suggesting non-significant adverse effects of trace elements on human health. This study provided better understanding of various pollutants and their concentrations in water sources at the studied location.

TI Groundwater-surface water interactions derived by hydrochemical and
   isotopic (Rn-222 deuterium, oxygen-18) tracers in the Nomhon area,
   Qaidam Basin, NW China
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB Understanding the interaction between groundwater and surface water is of vital significance for the sustainable management of water resources in arid and semi-arid areas. In this study, multi environmental tracers (hydrochemical parameters, stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and radioactive Rn-222) were employed to investigate the interaction between groundwater and surface water along two rivers (Tiangeli River and Nomhon River) in the Nomhon area, southeast of the arid Qaidam Basin, northwest China. Here we observed that the Rn-222 concentration of waters were distinctly different with a decrease order of groundwater > spring > river in this area. Along the Tiangeli River, the Rn-222 concentrations of groundwater, springs and river water were about 12,120-17,407, 3013-15,819 and 809-8205 Bq/m(3), respectively. This river was characterized by the high Rn-222 concentration of the river water and was investigated to be mainly fed by springs and groundwater discharge. Along the Nomhon river, Rn-222 concentration of groundwater and river water was about 6772-60,369 and 14-519 Bq/m(3), respectively. An average background of the Rn-222 concentration in the upstream of the river was determined to be about 43 Bq/m(3). A high Rn-222 concentration zone along the river appeared in the midstream, with a peak value of 519 Bq/m(3) and a distance about 10 km, indicating that groundwater discharged to the Nomhon River in the alluvial plain. A Rn-222 mass-balance model was constructed to estimate the groundwater discharge into the river, showing a maximum groundwater discharge of 0.37 m(3)/s in the midstream of Nomhon River during the sampling period. The stable isotopic compositions (delta D and delta O-18) and hydrochemical characteristics (hydrochemical type, TDS and EC) showed corresponding changes along these two rivers, which also provided evidences for the groundwater-surface water interactions in the Nomhon area.

TI Spatial distribution of pesticides in surface water of the Estacas
   stream (Argentine Espinal region) associated with crop production
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The Espinal region (Entre Rios, Argentina) has suffered land use changes caused by expansion of the agricultural frontier. This expansion has led to an increased use of pesticides. This study is aimed at better understanding the spatial distribution of pesticides in surface water of the Estacas stream, a representative basin of the Espinal region, associated with crop production. The location and proportion of area with soybean, maize, and wheat crops in each catchment area of the basin were estimated, and surface water samples were taken to perform a pesticide screening during a period of one year. Soybean represented approximately 71% of the total cultivated area of the basin, whereas maize and wheat accounted for 15% and 14%, respectively. The analysis of 125 analytes showed the presence of 19 pesticides. The pesticide load maps showed that atrazine was detected in an area of relatively low catchment compared to other pesticides as glyphosate, which is applied in all the agricultural fields of the basin. The load of metolachlor and S-metolachlor covered a large area of the basin. The highest recorded concentrations of these pesticides were 86 mu g L-1 of atrazine, 24 mu g L-1 of metolachlor, 19 mu g L-1 of glyphosate, and 15 mu g L-1 of S-metolachlor. The results allow better understanding the environmental distribution of pesticides associated with pest control in the crops of the basin studied, the doses and times of application, and the variation in the rainfall in the basin. This study provides relevant information about how aquatic ecosystems in agricultural basins receive the diffuse contribution of pesticides, representing potential sources of water pollution. Also, the results allow supporting the design of agricultural practices and politics to improve land-use planning for the development of sustainable basins.

TI Comprehensive assessment of water resources in the united arab emirates
   (UAE)
SO WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB Lack of sufficient quantities of water in the UAE is one of the major problems facing sustainable development. The arid climate of the country plays a significant role in the water resources availability. Rainfall, which is a main source of recharge for different water resources, such as surface water and groundwater, is scanty and extremely irregular in time and space. Evaporation, which reduces the amount of surface water, is high. Heavy pumping of groundwater has deteriorated groundwater levels. Desalination plants have been launched in different parts of the country to meet increasing water demands due to increasing population and economical development in the country. The continued reduction of water storage will hinder the development in the country. To avoid this problem, integrated water resources management (IWRM) strategy should be implemented. Searching for new non-conventional resources is also essential. This paper aims to assess the conventional and non-conventional water resources in the UAE and estimates the past and future water demands. In addition, this article focuses on future water strategy scenarios and plans.

TI Effect of Pollution and Seasonal Variability on The Water Quality in
   Different Sites of The River Nile, Aswan, Egypt
SO EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB SURFACE water quality and the seasonal dynamics of the Nile River in the Aswan district were analyzed using multivariate data analysis and overall pollution index (OPI) analysis. Water samples were collected from four sampling sites, including a reference site (site 1) and three sites receiving effluents from different pollution sources, e.g., domestic-like pollutants (site 2), industrial (site 3), and agricultural effluents (site 4). Different water quality parameters, such as physicochemical characteristics and nutrient minerals, were analyzed in the selected sites.The average OPI values were calculated by classifying the surface water quality of each siteas follows:at site 1 (1.65: excellent), site 2 (2.70:acceptable), site 3 (11.75:polluted), and site 4 (5.08:slightly polluted). In each site, the OPI values varied seasonally within the range of water quality class, except, in autumn at site 4, the OPI value was 10.00, and hence the water quality class was changed to (polluted).Generally, it was concluded that the industrial effluents had an adverse effect on the surface water quality of the Nile River, Aswan. Consequently, special concerns should be assumed to maintain environmental sustainability.

TI Zizania aquatica-duck ecosystem with recycled biogas slurry maintained
   crop yield
SO NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
AB The Chinese government recently adopted the concept of ecological circular agriculture in a bid to increase recycling of agricultural waste and reduce chemical fertilizer input. Field experiments were conducted in 2015 and 2016 to determine the effects of a Zizania aquatica-duck ecosystem supplemented with recycled biogas slurry and no chemical fertilizers on Z. aquatica yield, plant nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) uptake, and NP concentrations in the surface water. Compared with Z. aquatica monoculture plus chemical fertilizer (Zcf treatment), the Z. aquatica-duck ecosystem with biogas slurry and no chemical fertilizer (Zbs-D treatment) maintained yield (approximately 24.48 t ha(-1)) and N and P uptake (approximately 3.15 and 0.98 g plant(-1), respectively). Although N and P concentrations in the surface water were approximately 3.11 times higher under Zbs-D than Zcf treatment, concentrations in the draining surface water (4.54 mg N L-1 and 0.74 mg P L-1) met the discharge standard (5.00 mg N L-1 and 1.00 mg P L-1). These findings suggest that the Zbs-D ecosystem could be used to completely substitute chemical fertilizers in Z. aquatica production without yield losses via safe application of biogas slurry. In turn, this system would also increase the sustainability of Z. aquatica crop production in an environmentally-friendly manner. Simple and efficient methods for determining the NP content of biogas slurry are now required in addition to further long-term monitoring.

TI Reservoir water quality: a case from Jordan
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB Jordan relies heavily on reservoirs building and development to cope with water supply challenges, where monitoring and assessment of reservoir water quality are critically important for the sustainable use of these water supplies. Mujib Dam is an important water supply source in central western Jordan. Evaluation of water quality parameters and their spatial distributions (vertical and horizontal) showed near-neutral pH values with nearly similar values from surface to bottom. The vertical profile of DO and TDS in the dammed reservoir showed slight decreasing trends with increasing depth. Although Ca, Mg, Na, and K concentrations varied slightly with depths, their variations showed no trends. Similarly, the vertical and horizontal distribution patterns of Cl, SO4, HCO3, NO3, and PO4 in Mujib reservoir water showed insignificant variations in surface water layer and relatively unchanged values or decreasing trends through the water column. Higher values of TN have been observed, especially in the western part, suggesting that agricultural activities and livestock farming in the upstream catchment are impacting water quality. Results revealed that weathering and dissolution of rocks are the major source of water chemistry. The majority of trace metal levels (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn, Co, Ni, Sr, and B) in water showed relatively similar surface and bottom values. The concentrations of COD and BOD5 in surface water were relatively low with higher concentrations observed in the northwestern corner, coincided with higher levels of chlorophyll a. The average ratio of TN to TP in surface water suggests that phosphorus is the limiting factor for the algal blooms, whereas the average chlorophyll a level in surface water indicates oligo-mesotrophic water.

TI An economic assessment of local farm multi-purpose surface water
   retention systems in a Canadian Prairie setting
SO APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
AB There is a need to explore more sustainable approaches to water management on the Canadian Prairies. Retention pond installation schemes designed to capture surface water may be a viable option that would reduce water stress during drought periods by providing water for irrigation. The retention systems would serve to capture excess spring runoff and extreme rainfall events, reducing flood potential downstream. Additionally, retention ponds may be used for biomass production and nutrient retention. The purpose of this research was to investigate the economic viability of adopting local farm surface water retention systems as a strategic water management strategy. A retention pond was analyzed using a dynamic simulation model to predict its storage capacity, installation and upkeep cost, and economic advantage to farmers when used for irrigation. While irrigation application increased crop revenue, the cost of irrigation and reservoir infrastructure and installation costs were too high for the farmer to experience a positive net revenue. Farmers who harvest cattails from retention systems for biomass and available carbon offset credits can gain $642.70/hectare of harvestable cattail/year. Cattail harvest also removes phosphorus and nitrogen, providing a monetized impact of $7014/hectare of harvestable cattail/year. The removal of phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon, and avoided flooding damages of the retention basin itself provide an additional $17,730-$18,470/hectare of retention system/year. The recommended use of retention systems is for avoided flood damages, nutrient retention, and biomass production. The revenue gained from these functions can support farmers wanting to invest in irrigation while providing economic and environmental benefits to the region.

TI Disconnected Surface Water and Groundwater: From Theory to Practice
SO GROUND WATER
AB When describing the hydraulic relationship between rivers and aquifers, the term disconnected is frequently misunderstood or used in an incorrect way. The problem is compounded by the fact that there is no definitive literature on the topic of disconnected surface water and groundwater. We aim at closing this gap and begin the discussion with a short introduction to the historical background of the terminology. Even though a conceptual illustration of a disconnected system was published by Meinzer (1923), it is only within the last few years that the underlying physics of the disconnection process has been described. The importance of disconnected systems, however, is not widely appreciated. Although rarely explicitly stated, many approaches for predicting the impacts of groundwater development on surface water resources assume full connection. Furthermore, management policies often suggest that surface water and groundwater should only be managed jointly if they are connected. However, although lowering the water table beneath a disconnected section of a river will not change the infiltration rate at that point, it can increase the length of stream that is disconnected. Because knowing the state of connection is of fundamental importance for sustainable water management, robust field methods that allow the identification of the state of connection are required. Currently, disconnection is identified by showing that the infiltration rate from a stream to an underlying aquifer is independent of the water table position or by identifying an unsaturated zone under the stream. More field studies are required to develop better methods for the identification of disconnection and to quantify the implications of heterogeneity and clogging processes in the streambed on disconnection.

TI RETRACTED: The hydrochemical framework of surface water basins in
   southern Ghana (Retracted article. See vol. 69, pg. 1783, 2013)
SO ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY
AB Surface water resources play a crucial role in the domestic water delivery system in Ghana. In addition, sustainable food production is based on the quality and quantity of water resources available for irrigation purposes to supplement rain-fed agricultural activities in the country. The objective of this research was to determine the main controls on the hydrochemistry of surface water resources in the southern part of Ghana and assess the quality of water from these basins for irrigation activities in the area. R-mode factor and cluster analyses were applied to 625 data points from 6 river basins in southern Ghana after the data had been log transformed and standardized for homogeneity. This study finds that surface water chemistry in the south is controlled by the chemistry of silicate mineral weathering, chemistry of rainfall, fertilizers from agricultural activities in the area, as well as the weathering of carbonate minerals. A Gibb's diagram plotted with total dissolved solids (TDS) on the vertical axis against (Na+ + K+)/(Ca2+ + K+ + Na+) on the horizontal axis indicates that rock weathering plays a significant role in the hydrochemistry. Activity diagrams for the CaO-Na2O-Al2O-SiO2-H2O and CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O systems suggest that kaolinite is the most stable clay mineral phase in the system. In addition, an assessment of the irrigation quality of water from these basins suggests that the basins are largely low sodium-low to medium salinity basins, delivering water of acceptable quality for irrigation purposes.

TI Land use and land cover changes in Zezere watershed (Portugal) - Water
   quality implications
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB To understand the relations between land use allocation and water quality preservation within a watershed is essential to assure sustainable development. The land use and land cover (LUC) within Zezere River watershed registered relevant changes in the last decades. These land use and land cover changes (LUCCs) have impacts in water quality, mainly in surface water degradation caused by surface runoff from artificial and agricultural areas, forest fires and burnt areas, and caused by sewage discharges from agroindustry and urban sprawl. In this context, the impact of LUCCs in the quality of surface water of the Zezere watershed is evaluated, considering the changes for different types of LUC and establishing their possible correlations to the most relevant water quality changes. The results indicate that the loss of coniferous forest and the increase of transitional woodland-shrub are related to increased water's pH; while the growth in artificial surfaces and pastures leads mainly to the increase of soluble salts and fecal coliform concentration. These particular findings within the Zezere watershed, show the relevance of addressing water quality impact driven from land use and should therefore be taken into account within the planning process in order to prevent water stress, namely within watersheds integrating drinking water catchments.

TI The hydrochemical characteristics and evolution of groundwater and
   surface water in the Heihe River Basin, northwest China
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB A combination of isotopic and chemical indicators has been used to characterize rainfall, surface water and groundwater in the Heihe River Basin, China. Surface- vs. groundwater chemistry data enabled geographical zones and chemical types to be differentiated. The dissolution of halite, Glauber's salt, gypsum, dolomite and calcite determine Na+, Cl-, Mg2+, Ca2+, SO42- and HCO3- chemistry, but other processes such as evaporation, ion exchange, and deposition also influence the water composition. The majority of deep confined groundwaters are tritium-free and less mineralized than in the shallow aquifer. Radiocarbon values in the deeper groundwaters range from 18.8 to 38.9 pmc, and 80 pmc probably represents the upper limit of initial C-14 activity; this yields ages of approximately 5,960-11,971 years BP, which is about 3,000 years older than those calculated by models in previous work. The shallow aquifer exhibits fairly high and variable tritium activities (4-75 TU), evidence of recent recharge and low residence time (<60 years), which is in line with estimates from previous work. Isotopic signatures indicate formation of deeper groundwaters in a colder and wetter climate during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. The results suggested that significant changes are urgently needed in water-use strategy to achieve sustainable development.

TI From Fresh to Marine Waters: Characterization and Fate of Dissolved
   Organic Matter in the Lena River Delta Region, Siberia
SO FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB Connectivity between the terrestrial and marine environment in the Artic is changing as a result of climate change, influencing both freshwater budgets, and the supply of carbon to the sea. This study characterizes the optical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) within the Lena Delta region and evaluates the behavior of DOM across the fresh water-marine gradient. Six fluorescent components (four humic-like; one marine humic-like; one protein-like) were identified by Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) with a clear dominance of allochthonous humic-like signals. Colored DOM (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were highly correlated and had their distribution coupled with hydrographical conditions. Higher DOM concentration and degree of humification were associated with the low salinity waters of the Lena River. Values decreased toward the higher salinity Laptev Sea shelf waters. Results demonstrate different responses of DOM mixing in relation to the vertical structure of the water column, as reflecting the hydrographical dynamics in the region. Two mixing curves for DOM were apparent. In surface waters above the pycnocline there was a sharper decrease in DOM concentration in relation to salinity indicating removal. In the bottom water layer the DOM decrease within salinity was less. We propose there is a removal of DOM occurring primarily at the surface layer, which is likely driven by photodegradation and flocculation.

TI Assessment of Microplastics Distribution and Related Water Quality in an
   Urban Canal, Thailand
SO POLLUTION
AB Microplastics pollution has become a matter of global concern because of its effects on aquatic life and the ecosystem. This study investigated the abundance and types of microplastics found in an urban canal of Thailand. Water quality and the relationship between microplastics pollutants and the physicochemical properties of water quality were also analyzed to provide evidence for this study. The mean abundance of microplastics was 370 +/- 140 particle(p)/m(3). The highest number and concentration of microplastics were found on surface water corelated with urbanization. Transparent brown and transparent colors in the form of film and fiber/lines were the predominant morphology. Polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) were the most abundant polymer type in all surface water samples. Furthermore, water quality was related with microplastic pollution. The physicochemical properties of turbidity (0.99), conductivity (0.97), total solid (0.95) and biological oxygen demand (0.84) were accounted for greatest influences on microplastics distribution. The estimated equation of microplastics was also closely corelated with water quality. These results demonstrate that microplastic pollution has progressed more in poor water quality than good water quality, indicating that the inflow process and sources of microplastics are similar to those of other pollutants. Therefore, this study is expected to encourage and enforce solid waste and wastewater management policies that prevent microplastics pollution in the environment.

TI Analysis of large-scale monitoring data to identify spatial and temporal

   water bodies of Po plain (Italy)
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB In Italy, the National Environmental Protection Agency (ISPRA) publishes annual reports containing the results of monitoring programs for pesticides in surface and groundwater. These programs were established to accomplish the EU Directives addressing the quality of water resources (drinking water, groundwater and surface water) such as the Water Framework Directive or the Directive on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides. These data can be extremely helpful for risk management actions as they can provide indications where to implement mitigation measures at the territorial scale. In this study, we extrapolated the monitoring data (period 2008-2017) of terbuthylazine and its metabolite desethyl-terbuthylazine in the surface water bodies of the Po plain (Northern Italy).
   Then, these data were utilized to apply a methodology based on a previous work proposed and published by our research team, which combine, in two distinct phases, historical series of monitoring data and GIS.
   Overall, the results allowed to identify three areas where to focus risk mitigation measures, which correspond to the low part of the Lombardy (Lodi, Cremona and Mantua area), the area between the Padua and Venice provinces in Veneto and the area of Ferrara in Emilia Romagna.

TI Effect of low temperature on the performance of a gravity flow
   CANON-like pilot plant MBR treating surface water
SO DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT
AB A gravity flow completely autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite (CANON)-like pilot plant Membrane bio-reactor was designed to treat surface water for indirect potable reuse and was operated for over sevenmonths with a constant Trans-membrane pressure of 100mbar after the start-up phase. The effect of low temperature on the performance of autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite was investigated over a seven-month period during which the feed water temperature changed from 29 degrees C to 1 degrees C and the viscosity of the permeate more than doubled. The process showed good biostability and sustainability across the different seasons. Initially when the temperature fell below 10 degrees C (which seems like a turning point for the activity of ANAMMOX bacteria) high fluctuations happened, but the activity of ANAMMOX bacteria recovered in 18d. Increasing Hydrogen retention time during this period was the means by which one can successfully compensate for low temperature. The dissolved oxygen (DO) (7.12-10.9mg/L) in the raw water supported the partial nitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX) process without the use of aeration. There was high ammonium (up to 5mg/L) removal even at extremely low temperatures of 1 degrees C.

TI Environmental Concentrations of the Type 2 Diabetes Medication Metformin
   and Its Transformation Product Guanylurea in Surface Water and Sediment
   in Ontario and Quebec, Canada
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB Metformin, used to treat Type 2 diabetes, is the active ingredient of one of the most prescribed drugs in the world, with over 120 million yearly prescriptions globally. In wastewater-treatment plants (WWTPs), metformin can undergo microbial transformation to form the product guanylurea, which could have toxicological relevance in the environment. Surface water samples from 2018 to 2020 and sediment samples from 2020 were collected from six mixed-use watersheds in Quebec and Ontario, Canada, and analyzed to determine the metformin and guanylurea concentrations at each site. Metformin and guanylurea were present above their limits of quantification in 51.0% and 50.7% of all water samples and in 64% and 21% of all sediment samples, respectively. In surface water, guanylurea was often present at higher concentrations than metformin, while the inverse was true in sediment, with metformin frequently detected at higher concentrations than guanylurea. In addition, at all sites influenced solely by agriculture, concentrations of metformin and guanylurea were <1 & mu;g/L in surface water, suggesting that agriculture is not a significant source of these compounds in the investigated watersheds. These data suggest that WWTPs and potentially septic system leaks are the most likely sources of the compounds in the environment. Guanylurea was detected at many of these sites above environmental concentrations of concern, where critical processes in fish may be affected. Due to the scarcity of available ecotoxicological data and the prominence of guanylurea across all sample sites, there is a need to perform more toxicological investigations of this transformation product and revisit regulations. The present study will help provide toxicologists with environmentally relevant concentration ranges in Canada.

TI Potential effects of climate chance on surface-water quality in North
   America
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
AB Data from long-term ecosystem monitoring and research stations in North America and results of simulations made with interpretive models indicate that changes in climate (precipitation and temperature) can have a significant effect on the quality of surface waters. Changes in water quality during storms, snowmelt, and periods of elevated air temperature or drought can cause conditions that exceed thresholds of ecosystem tolerance and, thus, lead to water-quality degradation. If warming and changes in available moisture occur, water-quality changes will likely first occur during episodes of climate-induced stress, and in ecosystems where the factors controlling water quality are sensitive to climate variability. Continued climate stress would increase the frequency with which ecosystem thresholds are exceeded and thus lead to chronic water-quality changes. Management strategies in a warmer climate will therefore be needed that are based on local ecological thresholds rather than annual median condition. Changes in land use alter biological, physical, and chemical processes in watersheds and thus significantly alter the quality of adjacent surface waters; these direct human-caused changes complicate the interpretation of water-quality changes resulting from changes in climate, and can be both mitigated and exacerbated by climate change. A rigorous strategy for integrated, long-term monitoring of the ecological and human factors that control water quality is necessary to differentiate between actual and perceived climate effects, and to track the effectiveness of our environmental policies.

TI A review of conjunctive GW-SW management by simulation-optimization
   tools
SO AQUA-WATER INFRASTRUCTURE ECOSYSTEMS AND SOCIETY
AB The conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water (GW-SW) resources has grown worldwide. Optimal conjunctive water use can be planned by coupling hydrologic models for the simulation of water systems with optimization techniques for improving management strategies. The coupling of simulation and optimization methods constitutes an effective approach to determine sustainable management strategies for the conjunctive use of these water resources; yet, there are challenges that must be addressed. This paper reviews (1) hydrologic models applied for the simulation of GW-SW interaction in the water resources systems, (2) conventional optimization methods, and (3) published works on optimized conjunctive GW-SW use by coupling simulation and optimization methods. This paper evaluates the pros and cons of GW-SW simulation tools and their applications, thus providing criteria for selecting simulation-optimization methods for GW-SW management. In addition, an assessment of GW-SW simulation-optimization tools applied in various studies over the world creates valuable knowledge for selecting suitable simulation-optimization tools in similar case studies for sustainable water resource management under multiple scenarios.

TI Automated SAR Image Thresholds for Water Mask Production in Alberta's
   Boreal Region
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Mapping and monitoring surface water features is important for sustainably managing this critical natural resource that is in decline due to numerous natural and anthropogenic pressures. Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar is a popular and inexpensive solution for such exercises over large scales through the application of thresholds to distinguish water from non-water. Despite improvements to threshold methods, threshold selection is traditionally manual, which introduces subjectivity and inconsistency over large scales. This study presents a novel method for objectively determining and applying a threshold to determine water masks from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery on a scene-by-scene basis. The method was applied to Radarsat-2 and simulated Radarsat Constellation Mission scenes, and validated against two independent validation sources with high accuracy (Kappa ranging from 0.85 to 0.93). Expectedly, greatest misclassification occurs near shorelines, which are often ecologically important zones. Comparisons between Radarsat-2 and Radarsat Constellation Mission thresholds and outputs suggest that the latter is a capable successor for surface water applications. This work represents a foundational step toward objectivity and consistency in large-scale water mapping and monitoring.

TI Household slow sand filters in intermittent and continuous flow for a
   long-term surface water treatment: Efficiencies assessment and
   operational challenges
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB The Household Slow Sand Filter (HSSF) is a Point-Of-Use technology that has several technical, constructive, and operational advantages, which allows users to improve the quality of their own drinking water at home. This paper aims to provide results concerning the real possibility of treating surface water using HSSF with two feeding strategies, covering more than one year of operation (430 days), including seasons with different inputs on surface water. To do this, we compared the intermittent (HSSF-I) and the continuous (HSSF-C) feeding strategies in quantitative terms (filtered water quality and treatment efficiency) and qualitative terms (con-struction, cost, and operational challenges). Overall, both HSSF models were efficient and improved the water quality, but HSSF-C produced better quality filtered water in terms of turbidity (73 ( +/- 20)% versus 69 ( +/- 18)%), Escherichia coli (2.06 ( +/- 0.60) log versus 1.65 ( +/- 0.78) log), Giardia cysts (>3 log versus 2.89 ( +/- 0.32) log), and Cryptosporidium oocysts (1.22 ( +/- 0.10) log versus 0.95 ( +/- 0.45) log) than HSSF-I. In addition, HSSF-C was able to remain more stable throughout the entire operation, without major impacts caused by influent water variations and maintenance activities. On the other hand, HSSF-I was cheaper, took up less space in the house, had a simple and easy operation, and did not require as much maintenance as the continuous one. Results indicated that HSSF-C may be a more viable model for treating surface water, but it still needs to improve its transfer requirements and assess its user acceptability from field experiences.

TI Meta-analysis of the prevalence of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in
   water and wastewater and review of DON removal and recovery strategies
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Most wastewater removal and recovery processes primarily target dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) species, leaving the untreated non-reactive dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in the effluent. This DON fraction can account for a substantial part of the total nitrogen (N) load. We analyzed large datasets of N species and concentrations (with a focus on quantifying the fraction of DON) in surface water, ground water, and wastewater effluent across the United States. We then reviewed strategies to remove and recover DON based on results of a range of treatment technologies reported in the literature, including laboratory-scale up to full-scale operation in wastewater treatment plants. Our meta-analysis showed that DON concentrations are greatest in wastewater effluent followed by surface water and groundwater. The concentration of DON in wastewater effluent varied from 0.01 to 10.9 mg N/L (number of data points, n = 163), where the range in surface water was 0.002 to 14.3 mg N/L (n= 11,803). Organic N accounted for the majority of total N in 12.3% of wastewater effluent samples and 49.1% of surface waters. Our literature review showed that currently available wastewater treatment processes do not efficiently target DON removal nor recovery of the DON as a valuable product. One potential DON removal and recovery strategy is transforming DON into DIN, which is generally more easily removed and recovered. Transformation strategies reported in the literature include ozonation, UV/H2O2, and electrooxidation. However, as advanced oxidation processes are often energy- and cost-intensive, further research is needed to improve DON removal and recovery.

TI Occurrence, distribution, and risk assessment of antibiotics in the
   surface water of Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB SPE-UPLC-MS/MS was used to investigate the occurrence of 18 target antibiotics in the surface water of Poyang Lake over different seasons of 2014-2015. The maximum concentrations of sulfadiazine, oxytetracycline, and doxycycline were 56.2, 48.7, and 39.7 ng/L, respectively. Compared with those in the other lakes or surface waters, the surface water of Poyang Lake contained moderate or below-average levels of antibiotics. The significantly lower concentrations (P < 0.01) of roxithromycin in June 2015 likely resulted from the dilution effect of water flow during the flood season. Antibiotic concentrations were higher in site P3-1 than in other sites (P < 0.01), whereas those in other sites (P1-1, P2-1, P5-1, P6-1, P7-1, P13-1, P16-1, P17-1, P18-1) were not significantly different (P > 0.05). Given that tetracyclines and sulfonamides are common veterinary medicines, the high concentrations of oxytetracycline, doxycycline, and sulfadiazine in site P3-1 might be closely related to agricultural production in the surrounding areas. The risk assessment of the main antibiotic contaminants revealed that the majority of the risk quotients of the target antibiotics were below 0.01, thereby indicating the minimal risk of these antibiotics to organisms at three different trophic levels. Sulfadimidine and sulfadiazine were identified as the main antibiotics that contribute to ecological risk in Poyang Lake, and that the daphnid is the main model organisni exposed to these risks. This study provides important data for antibiotic pollution control and environmental protection in the study area and enriches environmental monitoring data on a global scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the status of soil salinization and its controlling factors are summarized for the Yinchuan Plain, North-West China. The conjunctive use of surface water diverted from the Yellow River and groundwater abstracted from a shallow aquifer is proposed to alleviate soil salinization in the plain. Scenarios are designed and simulated to determine the optimal proportions at which groundwater should be exploited for irrigation in the three cities of the plain. Policies and suggestions regarding sustainable water resources and soil salinization research in the plain are recommended.

TI PURE: A web-based decision support system to evaluate pesticide
   environmental risk for sustainable pest management practices in
   California
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB Farmers, policy makers, and other stakeholders seek tools to quantitatively assess pesticide risks for mitigating pesticide impacts on ecosystem and human health. This paper presents the Pesticide Use Risk Evaluation (PURE) decision support system (DSS) for evaluating site-specific pesticide risks to surface water, groundwater, soil, and air across pesticide active ingredient (AI), pesticide product, and field levels. The risk score is determined by the ratio of the predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) to the toxicity value for selected endpoint organism(s); except that the risk score for the air is calculated using the emission potential (EP), which is a pesticide product property for estimating potential volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions by California Environmental Protection Agency (CEPA). The risk scores range from 0 to 100, where 0 represents negligible risk while 100 means the highest risk. The procedure for calculating PEC in surface water was evaluated against monitoring data for 41 pesticide AIs, with a statistically significant correlation coefficient of r=0.82 (p < 0.001). In addition, two almond fields in the Central Valley, California were evaluated for pesticide risks as a case study, where the commonly acknowledged high-risk pesticides gained high risk scores. Simazine, one of the most frequently detected pesticides in groundwater, was scored as 74 (the moderate high risk class) to groundwater; and chlorpyrifos, one of the frequently detected pollutants in surface water, was scored as 100 (the high risk class) to surface water. In support of pesticide risk quantitative assessment and use of reduced-risk pesticide selection, the PURE-DSS can be useful to assist growers, pesticide control advisors, and environmental protection organizations in mitigating pesticide use impacts on the environment.

TI Future Changes of Tropical Cyclones in the Midlatitudes in 4-km-mesh
   Downscaling Experiments from Large-Ensemble Simulations
SO SOLA
AB To understand the impacts of global warming on tropical cyclones (TCs) in midlatitude regions, dynamical downscaling experiments were performed using a 4-km-mesh regional model with a one-dimensional slab ocean model. Around 100 downscaling experiments for midlatitude TCs that traveled over the sea east of Japan were forced by large-ensemble climate change simulations of both current and warming climates. Mean central pressure and radius of maximum wind speed of simulated current-climate TCs increased as the TCs moved northward into a baroclinic environment with decreasing sea surface temperature (SST). In the warming-climate simulations, the mean central pressure of TCs in the analysis regions decreased from 958 hPa to 948 hPa: 12% of the warming-climate TCs were of an unusual central pressure lower than 925 hPa. In the warming climate, atmospheric conditions were strongly stabilized, however, the warming-climate TCs could develope, because the storms developed taller and stronger eyewall updrafts owing to higher SSTs and larger amounts of near-surface water vapor. When mean SST and near-surface water vapor were significantly higher and baroclinicity was significantly smaller, unusual intense TCs with extreme wind speeds and large amounts of precipitation around a small eye, could develop in midlatitude regions, retaining the axisymetric TC structures.

TI Tracking nutrient and productivity variations over the last deglaciation
   in the Arctic Ocean
SO PALEOCEANOGRAPHY
AB We have reconstructed the surface water environment of the Arctic Ocean over the last similar to 50,000 years using measurements of the organic nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios, carbonate and total organic carbon concentrations (TOC), and terrestrial biomarkers (lignin and long-chain n-alkanes) in four multicores. Variations in nitrogen isotope ratios that are concordant with TOC and carbonate concentrations (representing foraminifera and excluding ice-rafted-debris) reflect differences in relative nutrient utilization of phytoplankton in the surface waters. However, delta N-15 variations also appear to be dependent on the stratification of the water column and therefore potentially track the exchange of nutrients between deep and surface waters. Low Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) delta N-15 values and higher Holocene values are opposite to those recorded in the Southern Ocean. The Arctic Ocean with higher nutrient utilization today compared to the LGM therefore acts as a counterpart to the Southern Ocean, although the global impact on carbon dioxide variations compared to the Southern Ocean is probably low.

TI A Water Balancing Act: Water Balances Highlight the Benefits of
   Community-Based Adaptive Management in Northern New Mexico, USA
SO HYDROLOGY
AB Quantifying groundwater recharge from irrigation in water-scarce regions is critical for sustainable water management in an era of decreasing surface water deliveries and increasing reliance on groundwater pumping. Through a water balance approach, our study estimated deep percolation (DP) and characterized surface water and groundwater interactions of two flood-irrigated fields in northern New Mexico to evaluate the regional importance of irrigation-related recharge in the context of climate change. DP was estimated for each irrigation event from precipitation, irrigation input, runoff, change in soil water storage, and evapotranspiration data for both fields. Both fields exhibited positive, statistically significant relationships between DP and total water applied (TWA), where one field exhibited positive, statistically significant relationships between DP and groundwater level fluctuation (GWLF) and between GWLF and total water applied. In 2021, total DP on Field 1 was 739 mm, where 68% of irrigation water applied contributed to DP. Field 2's total DP was 1249 mm, where 81% of irrigation water applied contributed to DP. Results from this study combined with long-term research indicate that the groundwater recharge and flexible management associated with traditional, community-based irrigation systems are the exact benefits needed for appropriate climate change adaptation.

TI Simulation-Optimization Model for Conjunctive Management of Surface
   Water and Groundwater for Agricultural Use
SO WATER
AB The conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater resources is essential to sustainably manage water resources. The target study is the Osan watershed, in which approximately 60-70% of rainfall occurs during the summer monsoon in Central South Korea. Surface water resources are overexploited six times as much as groundwater resources in this region, leading to increasing pressure to satisfy the region's growing agricultural water demand. Therefore, a simulation-optimization (S-O) model at the sub-basin scale is required to optimize water resource allocation in the Osan watershed. An S-O model based on an artificial neural network (ANN) model coupled with Jaya algorithm optimization (JA) was used to determine the yearly conjunctive supply of agricultural water. The objective was to minimize the water deficit in the watershed subject to constraints on the cumulative drawdown in each subarea. The ANN model could predict the behaviour of the groundwater level and facilitate decision making. The S-O model could minimize the water deficit by approximately 80% in response to the gross water demand, thereby proving to be suitable for a conjunctive management model for water resource management and planning.

TI Past and future pesticide losses to Chinese waters under socioeconomic
   development and climate change
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Increasing pesticide use pollutes Chinese surface waters. Pesticides often enter waters through surface runoff from agricultural fields. This occurs especially during heavy rainfall events. Socio-economic development and climate change may accelerate future loss of pesticides to surface waters due to increasing food production and rainfall events. The main objective of this study is to model past and future pesticide losses to Chinese waters under socio-economic development and climate change. To this end, we developed a pesticide model with local information to quantify the potential pesticide runoff from near-stream agriculture to surface waters after heavy rainfall. We project future trends in potential pesticide runoff. For this, we developed three scenarios: Sustainability, "Middle of the Road" and Economy-first. These scenarios are based on combined Shared Socio-economic Pathways and Representative Concentration Pathways. We identified hotspots with high potential pesticide runoff. The results show that the potential pesticide runoff increased by 45% from 2000 to 2010, nationally. Over 50% of the national pesticide runoff in 2000 was in five provinces. Over 60% of the Chinese population lived in pesticide polluted hotspots in 2000. For the future, trends differ among scenarios and years. The largest increase is projected for the Economy-first scenario, where the potential pesticide runoff is projected to increase by 85% between 2010 and 2099. Future pesticide pollution hotspots are projected to concentrate in the south and southeast of China. This is the net-effect of high pesticide application, intensive crop production and high precipitation due to climate change. In our scenarios, 58%-84% of the population is projected to live in pesticide polluted hotspots from 2050 onwards. These projections can support the development of regional management strategies to control pesticide pollution in waters in the future.

TI Synthesis of dominant plastic microfibre prevalence and pollution
   control feasibility in Chinese freshwater environments
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Microplastic pollution of freshwaters is known to be a great concern in China and these pollutants can be discharged into the coastal environment through fluvial processes, posing threats to the global marine ecosystem. This paper reviewed the literature measuring microplastic pollution in the Chinese freshwater environment and found that microfibres dominate other plastic morphologies in more than 65% of samples collected in surface water, sediments and effluents of wastewater treatment plants and domestic sewers. Current potential sources of microfibre pollution are identified including fishery activities, laundry sewage, and waste textiles according to previous research. Recommendations are offered using the circular economy management framework, such as textile waste reuse and recycling systems in China, for improving current control measures for microplastics in freshwaters.

TI Disposition of Drugs of Abuse and Their Metabolites in Wastewater as a
   Method of the Estimation of Drug Consumption
SO CURRENT DRUG METABOLISM
AB The occurrence of drugs and trace amounts of their metabolites in the aqueous environment has become a global problem. Nowadays, general information about drug use patterns results from indirect methods such as anonymous surveys and police crime statistics. Unfortunately, these sources of information determine drug use consumption indirectly and give only rough estimations about drug use trends. Therefore, in order to assess the real extent of this phenomenon, new objective tools are needed to monitor drug abuse on a large social and international scale. Several analytical methods have been developed to diagnose illicit drug consumption. GC-MS and HPLC-MS are the techniques of choice for the quantitative analysis of illicit drugs and their metabolites in clinical and forensic toxicology. These separation methods have been widely used for the determination of the occurrence of stimulatory drugs in different biological matrixes such as blood, urine, sweat, saliva and hair. Recently, a new direct and objective approach of monitoring drug use patterns has been proposed to estimate illicit drug consumption involving the measurement of urinary breakdown products in waste- and surface water. The approach proposed seems to be suitable for monitoring consumption in real time so that it is possible to identify trends in drug use patterns. The measurement of illicit drug residue in wastewater and surface water might become a standardized tool for the comprehensive assessment of drug abuse in populations.

TI Surface water-groundwater interactions in the Matusagarati wetland,
   Panama
SO WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB The Matusagarati wetland in the Panamanian Darien is one of the largest and most biologically diverse wetland ecosystems in Central America. Despite this, no hydrological studies have been conducted in the area due to its remoteness and difficult access. The aim of this research is to define the relationship between surface water and groundwater through the field and laboratory data obtained from the first monitoring network installed in the Matusagarati wetland. Variations registered in the isotopic relationships in surface water and groundwater show that the wetland receives contributions from rainfall as well as fluvial and estuarine water. There are areas of the wetland where one of these sources predominates, and others where they mix. In the wetland sector downstream the Tuira river, the groundwater presents a combination of freshwaters coming from Filo del Tallo and those coming from the Tuira river, whose high salinity reflects the estuary's influence. Meanwhile, in the upstream sector of the wetland, the groundwater is a mixture of river water and rainwater on the river ' s levee but behind it, rainwater predominates. In all cases, groundwater has Rare Earth Elements patterns like those of the Tuira river, highlighting the importance of river flooding as a source and support system for the wetland groundwater. Hydrological research such as this, presents a valuable opportunity to provide sound scientific information to promote sustainable management and environmental conservation of this unique wetland that is rapidly being transformed to cattle pasture and palm and rice cultivation.

TI Effects of climate and irrigation on GRACE-based estimates of water
   storage changes in major US aquifers
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Understanding climate and human impacts on water storage is critical for sustainable water-resources management. Here we assessed climate and human drivers of total water storage (TWS) variability from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites compared with drought severity and irrigation water use in 14 major aquifers in the United States. Results show that long-term variability in TWS tracked by GRACE satellites is dominated by interannual variability in most of the 14 major US aquifers. Low TWS trends in the humid eastern U.S. are linked to low drought intensity. Although irrigation pumpage in the humid Mississippi Embayment aquifer exceeded that in the semi-arid California Central Valley, a surprising lack of TWS depletion in the Mississippi Embayment aquifer is attributed to extensive streamflow capture. Marked storage depletion in the semi-arid southwestern Central Valley and south-central High Plains totaled similar to 90 km(3), about three times greater than the capacity of Lake Mead, the largest U.S. reservoir. Depletion in the Central Valley was driven by long-term droughts (<= 5 yr) amplified by switching from mostly surface water to groundwater irrigation. Low or slightly rising TWS trends in the northwestern (Columbia and Snake Basins) US are attributed to dampening drought impacts by mostly surface water irrigation. GRACE satellite data highlight synergies between climate and irrigation, resulting in little impact on TWS in the humid east, amplified TWS depletion in the semi-arid southwest and southcentral US, and dampened TWS deletion in the northwest and north central US Sustainable groundwater management benefits from conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater, inefficient surface water irrigation promoting groundwater recharge, efficient groundwater irrigation minimizing depletion, and increasing managed aquifer recharge. This study has important implications for sustainable water development in many regions globally.

TI Seasonal evolution of hydrographic properties in the Ross Sea,
   Antarctica, 1996-1997
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB This paper briefly describes hydrographic and chemical results from four seasonal process cruises in the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) Antarctic Environment and Southern Ocean Process Study (AESOPS) in the Ross Sea. The data include temperature, salinity, oxygen, nutrients (NO3-, NO2-, NH4+, PO4-3, Si(OH)(4)), titration alkalinity (TA), and total inorganic CO2 (TCO2). In early spring (mid-October to early November 1996) ice cover was near 100%. The water column exhibited only small ranges of potential temperature, salinity, nutrients, TA and TCO2. These nearly uniform conditions observed during this cruise were used as initial conditions from which to evaluate seasonal changes in biogeochemical properties. Later in the spring (November/December) of the following year (1997), an expanded polynya was present. In the summer (January) 1997, the sea-ice cover was minimal. Meltwater dilution and warming of exposed surface waters were at their maximum. Finally, in early austral autumn (April 1997) rapid cooling and freezing of surface waters and intensified vertical mixing of the water column resulted in a return toward winter conditions, but with significant depletion of nutrients still evident in surface waters. Modified circumpolar deep water (MCDW) was observed at similar to 175 degreesE., varying in location zonally with time. Beneath the MCDW, near the eastern end of the section at similar to 180 degrees, northward intrusion of ice shelf water (ISW) was persistent though variable. Among the biogeochemical changes observed along this section were: (1) Significant ammonium accretion at about 100 m; (2) appreciable nitrate drawdowns throughout the upper 20-40 m of the water column; (3) silicic acid depletions during the summer in the surface waters, which were largest at the western end of the study area; (4) an increase in TA largely due to the loss of NO3-; and (5) decreases in TCO2 close to expected values for consumption of carbon and nitrogen in "Redfield" proportions. Consistent with previous observations, N, P and Si never approached limiting concentrations during any of the cruises. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Inputs of Nutrients and Fecal Bacteria to Freshwaters from Irrigated
   Agriculture: Case Studies in Australia and New Zealand
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Increasing demand for global food production is leading to greater use of irrigation to supplement rainfall and enable more intensive use of land. Minimizing adverse impacts of this intensification on surface water and groundwater resources is of critical importance for the achievement of sustainable land use. In this paper we examine the linkages between irrigation runoff and resulting changes in quality of receiving surface waters and groundwaters in Australia and New Zealand. Case studies are used to illustrate impacts under different irrigation techniques (notably flood and sprinkler systems) and land uses, particularly where irrigation has led to intensification of land use. For flood irrigation, changes in surface water contaminant concentrations are directly influenced by the amount of runoff, and the intensity and kind of land use. Mitigation for flood irrigation is best achieved by optimizing irrigation efficiency. For sprinkler irrigation, leaching to groundwater is the main transport path for contaminants, notably nitrate. Mitigation measures for sprinkler irrigation should take into account irrigation efficiency and the proximity of intensive land uses to sensitive waters. Relating contaminant concentrations in receiving groundwaters to their dominant causes is often complicated by uncertainty about the subsurface flow paths and the possible pollutant sources, viz. drainage from irrigated land. This highlights the need for identification of the patterns and dynamics of surface and subsurface waters to identify such sources of contaminants and minimize their impacts on the receiving environments.

TI Experimental Dosing of Wetlands with Coagulants Removes Mercury from
   Surface Water and Decreases Mercury Bioaccumulation in Fish
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Mercury pollution is widespread globally, and strategies for managing mercury contamination in aquatic environments at necesary. We tested whether coagulation with,metal-based salts could remove mercury from wetland surface waters and decrease mercury bioaccumulation in fish. In a complete randomized block design, we constructed nine experimental wetlands in California's Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, stocked them with mosquito-fish (Gambusia affinis), and then continuously applied agricultural drainage water that was either untreated (control), or treated with polyaluminum chloride or ferric,sulfate coagulants. Total mercury and methylmercury concentrations in surface waters were decreased by 62% and 63% in polyaluminum chloride treated wetlands, and 50% and 76% in ferric sulfate treated wetlands compared to control wetlands. Specifically, following coagulation; mercury was transferred from the filtered fraction of water into the particulate fraction of water which then settled within the wetland. Mosquitofish mercury concentrations were decreased by 35% in ferric sulfate treated wetlands compared to,control wetlands.. There was no reduction in mosquitofish mercury concentrations. within the polyaluminum chloride treated wetlands, which may have been caused by production of bioavailable methylmercury within those wetlands. Coagulation may be an effective management strategy for reducing mercury contamination within wetlands, but further studies should explore Potential effects on wetland ecosystems.

TI Source apportionment of water pollutants in Poyang Lake Basin in China
   using absolute principal component score-multiple linear regression
   model combined with land-use parameters
SO FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Source apportionment of surface water is essential for effective pollution control and sustainable water management. Physical mechanism models usually need so much data and parameters for calibration that their application for complex hydrologic condition watershed becomes difficult. However, reverse source tracing methods only based on water quality parameters present a certain subjectivity and uncertainty. In this research, additional land-use parameters were applied as an auxiliary in principal component analysis (PCA) for accurate identification of pollution sources. Thirteen water quality parameters and two meteorology parameters were used in the PCA and absolute principal component score-multiple linear regression (APCS-MLR) model to quantitatively identify potential pollution sources and their contributions to surface water pollution of the Poyang Lake Basin, in which frequent flow and sediment flux exchange with Yangtze River make the river-lake relationship complex. The results showed that urban wastewater with 34% contribution and agricultural non-point sources with 16% contribution, were the major sources of pollution in water quality. TP and NH3-N, the most serious pollutants, causing agricultural non-point source pollutions with 40% contributions and urban wastewater with 21% contributions were the major sources in the Poyang Lake Basin. Urban wastewater with 60% contributions was the major source of organic contamination. It can be concluded that with associated land-use parameters, the GIS approach with the APCS-MLR model can improve the accuracy and certainty of source apportionment, providing aid decision information for managers on protection of surface water quality.

TI Inferring Hydrological Information at the Regional Scale by Means of
   delta O-18-delta H-2 Relationships: Insights from the Northern Italian
   Apennines
SO HYDROLOGY
AB We compared five regression approaches, namely, ordinary least squares, major axis, reduced major axis, robust, and Prais-Winsten to estimate delta O-18-delta H-2 relationships in four water types (precipitation, surface water, groundwater collected in wells from lowlands, and groundwater from low-yield springs) from the northern Italian Apennines. Differences in terms of slopes and intercepts of the different regressions were quantified and investigated by means of univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistical analyses. We found that magnitudes of such differences were significant for water types surface water and groundwater (both in the case of wells and springs), and were related to robustness of regressions (i.e., standard deviations of the estimates and sensitiveness to outliers). With reference to surface water, we found the young water fraction was significant in inducing changes of slopes and intercepts, leading us to suppose a certain role of kinetic fractionation processes as well (i.e., modification of former water isotopes from both snow cover in the upper part of the catchments and precipitation linked to pre-infiltrative evaporation and evapotranspiration processes). As final remarks, due to the usefulness of delta O-18-delta H-2 relationships in hydrological and hydrogeological studies, we provide some recommendations that should be followed when assessing the abovementioned water types from the northern Italian Apennines.

TI Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) and Viral Detection in Polluted
   Surface Water: A Valuable Tool for COVID-19 Surveillance-A Brief Review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Disease clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic to severe multiple organ damage. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cellular receptor, which is abundantly expressed in the small intestine, allowing viral replication in the gastrointestinal tract. Viral RNA has been detected in the stool of COVID-19 patients and viable viruses had been isolated in some of these samples. Thus, a putative role of SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmission has been argued. SARS-CoV-2 is shed in human excreta and further disposed in the sewerage or in the environment, in poor basic sanitation settings. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a valuable population level approach for monitoring viral pathogens and has been successfully used in different contexts. This review summarizes the current global experience on SARS-CoV-2 WBE in distinct continents and viral detection in polluted surface water. The advantages and concerns of this strategy for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance are discussed. Outcomes suggest that WBE is a valuable early warning alert and a helpful complementary surveillance tool to subside public health response, to tailor containment and mitigation measures and to determine target populations for testing. In poor sanitation settings, contaminated rivers could be alternatively used as a source for environmental surveillance.

TI Occurrence, sources, and risk assessment of pyrethroid insecticides in
   surface water and tap water from Taihu Lake, China
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Pyrethroid insecticides are one of the most widely used insecticides globally, posing a severe threat to human health and the environment. In this study, we applied high-throughput organic analysis testing combined with high-volume solid-phase extraction (Hi-throat/Hi-volume SPE) to elucidate the occurrence of 11 pyrethroid insecticides in lake water (n = 37), tributary river water (n = 15), and tap water (n = 6) in the Taihu Lake Basin. Permethrin was found to be the major contributing pyrethroid insecticide (detection rate = 100%). The con-centrations of pyrethroid insecticides from different lake regions were revealed in the following descending order: southern > eastern > western > northern. The principal component analysis and multiple linear regression demonstrated that landscape maintenance, agricultural cultivation, and livestock breeding were the main sources of pyrethroid insecticides in the Taihu Lake surface water. Moreover, runoff input plays an important role in their accumulation, while the surrounding rivers contribute 2292 kg of pyrethroid insecticides to Taihu Lake annually. The risk assessment analysis demonstrated that pyrethroid insecticides pose a high risk to both the ecological environment and the surrounding human populations, thereby necessitating effective countermeasures. Furthermore, the pyrethroid insecticides in the Yangtze River Delta region have to be controlled. Overall, this is the first study focused on China that revealed the residue levels in water sources and tap water.

TI Cryptosporidium and Giardia in Wastewater and Surface Water Environments
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
AB Cryptosporidium and Giardia spp. are significant contributors to the global waterborne disease burden. Waterways used as sources of drinking water and for recreational activity can become contaminated through the introduction of fecal materials derived from humans and animals. Multiple studies have reported the occurence or concentrations of these pathogens in the environment. However, this information has not been comprehensively reviewed. Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) for Cryptosporidium and Giardia can be beneficial, but it often relies on the concentrations in environmental sources reported from the literature. A thorough literature review was conducted to develop an inventory of reported Cryptosporidium and Giardia concentrations in wastewater and surface water available in the literature. This information can be used to develop QMRA inputs. Cryptosporidium and Giardia (oo)cyst concentrations in untreated wastewater were up to 60,000 oocysts L-1 and 100,000 cysts L-1, respectively. The maximum reported concentrations for Cryptosporidium and Giardia in surface water were 8400 oocysts L-1 and 1000 cysts L-1, respectively. A summary of the factors for interpretation of concentration information including common quantification methods, survival and persistence, biofilm interactions, genotyping, and treatment removal is provided in this review. This information can help in identifying assumptions implicit in various QMRA parameters, thus providing the context and rationale to guide model formulation and application. Additionally, it can provide valuable information for water quality practitioners striving to meet the recreational water quality or treatment criteria. The goal is for the information provided in the current review to aid in developing source water protection and monitoring strategies that will minimize public health risks.

TI Characterization of ambient polychlorinated biphenyl background
   conditions in surface waters of the Pajarito Plateau, New Mexico
SO INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
AB This study presents the development of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) background threshold values (BTVs) that statistically characterize ambient background conditions for surface waters in undeveloped and developed landscapes of the Pajarito Plateau in the Rio Grande Basin of New Mexico. Between 2009 and 2018, surface water data were collected at 45 locations under a variety of flow conditions and regimes. A total of 163 samples were collected, with roughly 1/3 of samples and locations being in undeveloped areas (n = 53 from 17 locations), and the remainder being in developed areas (n = 110 from 28 locations). While there are areas on the Pajarito Plateau where PCB point sources are known or likely to have contributed to PCBs in soils, PCB BTVs calculated for undeveloped portions of watersheds (upstream of areas where PCB point sources are known or likely to have contributed to PCBs in soils, and therefore not affected by PCB sources within the watershed) are well above New Mexico's human health organism-only (HH-OO) water quality criterion (0.64 ng/L). Background threshold values are even higher in developed areas upstream of managed soil sites, suggesting that in developed areas, both diffuse ambient PCB sources (e.g., atmospheric deposition) and localized urban sources (e.g., building materials, paints, and electrical equipment) contribute to PCBs in those watersheds. These findings indicate that New Mexico's current HH-OO water quality criterion for PCBs cannot practicably be met due to ambient conditions. It is also impracticable to meet the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) criterion continuous concentration (CCC) of 14 ng/L in developed background areas, where the BTV is approximately 1.5 times the CCC.

TI Element variability in lacustrine systems of Terra Nova Bay (Antarctica)
   and concentration evolution in surface waters
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Major, minor and trace elements were determined in freshwater of lacustrine systems in Terra Nova Bay, along Victoria Land coast, Antarctica, as well as in algae and mosses. The samples were collected during some of the sampling campaigns between 2007 and 2011 (and the one of 2002) within the framework of the Italian National Program of Research in Antarctica (PNRA). Data were processed with chemometric techniques. Results showed that elements typically considered as potential anthropogenic pollutants (e.g. As, Pb, Zn, Cu and Ni) present a strong correlation with the lithogenic elements (e.g. Al, Si, Fe) in all matrices, suggesting that their origin is connected to natural phenomena. Metal concentrations in vegetation samples are in the same range as previously published data. The obtained results were compared with older literature data (since the early '90s) from the same lacustrine systems, in order to present a historical overview of element concentrations. This approach furnishes important information on surface water evolution as a function of time. A considerable variability was observed in metal concentrations but no clear trend was identified. This suggests that their concentration evolution is hardly correlated to specific natural or anthropic phenomena. No evidence of an increase of concentrations over time was apparent. Our results represent new important data about metal concentrations in lacustrine systems in Antarctica, furnishing ranges of values that can be considered as a reference. These data, therefore, could be used to detect or monitor future local andior global anthropogenic contaminations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Combining Multi-Sensor Satellite Imagery to Improve Long-Term Monitoring
   of Temporary Surface Water Bodies in the Senegal River Floodplain
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Accurate monitoring of surface water bodies is essential in numerous hydrological and agricultural applications. Combining imagery from multiple sensors can improve long-term monitoring; however, the benefits derived from each sensor and the methods to automate long-term water mapping must be better understood across varying periods and in heterogeneous water environments. All available observations from Landsat 7, Landsat 8, Sentinel-2 and MODIS over 1999-2019 are processed in Google Earth Engines to evaluate and compare the benefits of single and multi-sensor approaches in long-term water monitoring of temporary water bodies, against extensive ground truth data from the Senegal River floodplain. Otsu automatic thresholding is compared with default thresholds and site-specific calibrated thresholds to improve Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) classification accuracy. Otsu thresholding leads to the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and high overall accuracies on selected Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 images, but performance declines when applied to long-term monitoring compared to default or site-specific thresholds. On MODIS imagery, calibrated thresholds are crucial to improve classification in heterogeneous water environments, and results highlight excellent accuracies even in small (19 km2) water bodies despite the 500 m spatial resolution. Over 1999-2019, MODIS observations reduce average daily RMSE by 48% compared to the full Landsat 7 and 8 archive and by 51% compared to the published Global Surface Water datasets. Results reveal the need to integrate coarser MODIS observations in regional and global long-term surface water datasets, to accurately capture flood dynamics, overlooked by the full Landsat time series before 2013. From 2013, the Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 constellation becomes sufficient, and integrating MODIS observations degrades performance marginally. Combining Landsat and Sentinel-2 yields modest improvements after 2015. These results have important implications to guide the development of multi-sensor products and for applications across large wetlands and floodplains.

TI Pulsed redistribution of a contaminant following forest fire: Cesium-137
   in runoff
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
AB Of the natural processes that concentrate dispersed environmental contaminants, landscape fire stands out as having potential to rapidly concentrate contaminants and accelerate their redistribution. This study used rainfall simulation methods to quantify changes in concentration of a widely dispersed environmental contaminant (global fallout Cs-137) in soils and surface water runoff following a major forest fire at Los Alamos, New Mexico, USA. The Cs-137 concentrations at the ground surface increased up to 40 times higher in ash deposits and three times higher for the topmost 50 mm of soil compared with pre-fire soils. Average redistribution rates were about one order of magnitude greater for burned plots, 5.96 KBq ha(-1) mm(-1) rainfall, compared with unburned plots, 0.55 KBq ha(-1) mm(-1) rainfall. The greatest surface water transport of Cs-137, 11.6 KBq ha(-1) mm(-1), occurred at the plot with the greatest amount of ground cover removal (80% bare soil) following fire. Concentration. increases of Cs-137 occurred during surface water erosion, resulting in enrichment of Cs-137 levels in sediments by factors of 1.4 to 2.9 compared with parent soils. The elevated concentrations in runoff declined rapidly with time and cumulative precipitation occurrence and approached pre-fire levels after approximately 240 mm of rainfall. Our results provide evidence of order-of-magnitude concentration increases of a fallout radionuclide as a result of forest fire and rapid transport of radionuclides following fire that may have important implications for a wide range of geophysical, ecosystem, fire management, and risk-based issues.

TI Assessment of the physicochemical water quality of the Moulouya River,
   Morocco, using the SEQ-Eau index
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB Surface water is subject to strong anthropogenic pressures caused by the development and extension of agricultural activities and also by industrial and domestic activities. As a result, rational and sustainable management of water resources is necessary in order to protect them. The objective of this work is the use of geographic information system GIS and the application of the weighted index of the water quality evaluation system SEQ-Eau for the overall assessment of the physicochemical quality of surface waters of the Moulouya River. First, a cartographic representation of the study area was produced with the development of quality maps for the various alterations relating to acidification, temperature, mineralization, phosphorus materials, and organic and oxidizable materials. The overall quality map is generated from the lowest index of all the alterations considered. The results generally show surface water of excellent quality in the Upper Moulouya and of average to poor quality in the Middle and Lower Moulouya. The alteration of water, linked mainly to mineralization and phosphorus nutrients, organic and oxidizable matter, reveals a domestic type pollution in relation to urban wastewater and agricultural discharges in addition to the impact of the geological substratum of the watershed. The seasonal impact is influenced by the increase in the degree of deterioration of water quality due to the increase in the concentration of pollutants and the decrease in precipitation during the summer season.

TI Coupled Surface and Groundwater Hydrological Modeling in a Changing
   Climate
SO GROUNDWATER
AB Many current watershed modeling efforts now incorporate surface water and groundwater for managing water resources since the exchanges between groundwater and surface water need a special focus considering the changing climate. The influence of groundwater dynamics on water and energy balance components is investigated in the Snake River Basin (SRB) by coupling the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) and MODFLOW models (VIC-MF) for the period of 1986 through 2042. A 4.4% increase in base flows and a 10.3% decrease in peak flows are estimated by VIC-MF compared to the VIC model in SRB. The VIC-MF model shows significant improvement in the streamflow simulation (Nash-Suteliffe efficiency [NSE] of 0.84) at King Hill, where the VIC model could not capture the effect of spring discharge in the streamflow simulation (NSE of -0.30); however, the streamflow estimates show an overall decreasing trend. Two climate scenarios representing median and high radiative-forcings such as representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5 show an average increase in the water table elevations between 2.1 and 2.6 m (6.9 and 8.5 feet) through the year 2042. The spatial patterns of these exchanges show a higher groundwater elevation of 15 m (50 feet) in the downstream area and a lower elevation of up to 3 m (10 feet) in the upstream area. Broadly, this study supports results of previous work demonstrating that integrated assessment of groundwater-surface water enables stakeholders to balance pumping, recharge and base flow needs and to manage the watersheds that are subjected to human pressures more sustainably.

TI Quality assessment of surface and sediment pore waters and their
   behaviours using WQI index and geostatistics approaches. Case study: El
   Malleh dam reservoir, Morocco
SO GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
AB The El Malleh dam reservoir is an important water source for irrigation and protection against flooding in the Mohammedia region of the kingdom of Morocco. However, flash floods threaten the sustainability of the reservoir by sedimentation and water quality contamination. Pollution sources could arise from sediment mobilization in the reservoir bottom, or carry by water flow from the watershed to the dam reservoir. The current study evaluates the surface and pore water quality, focuses on their behaviour based on the laboratory results, the Water Quality Index (WQI) and statistical analysis. The results show that the concentration of nutrients was not significant. The concentrations of major elements differ from surface waters to pore waters and from one parameter to another. For instance, the Cl concentration in the surface water ranged from 852 mg L-1 to 1065 mg L-1, and from 10 mg L-1 to 7810 mg L-1 for pore water. Besides that, the calculation of WQI indicated that the sediment pore water quality was unsuitable, and the surface waters quality was in a poor and very poor category.

TI Effect of PAC dosage in a pilot-scale PAC-MBR treating micro-polluted
   surface water
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB To address the water scarcity issue and advance the traditional drinking water treatment technique, a powdered activated carbon-amended membrane bioreactor (PAC-MBR) is proposed for micro-polluted surface water treatment. A pilot-scale study was carried out by initially dosing different amounts of PAC into the MBR. Comparative results showed that 2 g/L performed the best among 0, 1, 2 and 3 g/L PAC-MBR regarding organic matter and ammonia removal as well as membrane flux sustainability. 1 g/L PAC-MBR exhibited a marginal improvement in pollutant removal compared to the non-PAC system. The accumulation of organic matter in the bulk mixture of 3 g/L PAC-MBR led to poorer organic removal and severer membrane fouling. Molecular weight distribution of the bulk liquid in 2 g/L PAC-MBR revealed the synergistic effects of PAC adsorption/biodegradation and membrane rejection on organic matter removal. Additionally, a lower amount of soluble extracellular polymer substances in the bulk can be secured in 21 days operation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI What if the rains do not come?
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB Risk-management solutions that increase opportunities for adaptation plans and resilience to climate change require an understanding of climate change processes and the trickle down effects of droughts and floods on hydrological and socio-economic systems. To guide future expectations about droughts, this study aims to assess large-scale variability of hydrological stores (groundwater, soil moisture, and surface water) and their responses to drought intensities over large semi-arid domains in Australia. Multi-scaled indicators synthesised from in-situ rainfall (SPI-standardised precipitation index), water budget (SPEI-standardised evapotranspiration precipitation index), model (soil moisture-SM), and satellite observations (groundwater storage-GWS, surface water extent-SWE, and terrestrial water storage-TWS) are employed to assess this variability in climatic hotspots identified through statistical rotation. The link between these hotspots and climate modes are diagnosed using gaussian kernel-based SVMR (support vector machine regression), and quantile function of storage (QFS) is used to assess the response of hydrological stores to climate variability. The capability of these indicators to capture impacts of water deficit on agricultural systems is explored by implementing a PLSR (partial least square regression). Results show that (i) drought characteristics and intensities vary greatly across Australia but hotspots of higher drought duration and intensity are predominant in regions below latitude 25 degrees S, (ii) hydrological drought indicators (SPEI/SPI-12) are better predictors of hydrological stores such as TWS and GWS, though the latter shows strong but opposite phase relationship with climate data, (iii) influence of climate teleconnections is better diagnosed and predicted with SPEI/SPI-12, and the Murray Darling basin-MDB (r = 0.84, alpha = 0.05) and central/east coast (r = 0.80, 0.79, alpha = 0.05) are major teleconnection hotspots, (iv) SM and GWS losses in the MDB occurred 60% and about 44% of the time, respectively, during the 2002 2017 period, (v) extreme events (droughts and floods) affect the distribution of SWE, and (vi) meteorological drought indicators (SPEI/SPI-3) are excellent metrics that capture variability in crop production. Choosing appropriate indicators that reflect the response of freshwater ecosystems (including groundwater) to climatic and anthropogenic constraints is part of a key process to guide investments in drought resilience and sustainable management of water resources.

TI Holistic Reduction to Compare and Create New Indices for Global
   Inter-Seasonal Monitoring: Case Study for High Resolution Surface Water
   Mapping
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB A remote sensing method that integrates virtual sampling from formalized visual interpretations is proposed to facilitate land cover mapping and enhance its accuracy, with an emphasis on spatial and temporal scalability. Indices are widely used for mapping and monitoring surface water across space and time; however, they typically display some kind of limitation across different environments and seasons. A decision matrix framework based on observations derived from interpretation keys was designed to compare the performance of existing indices alongside a set of newly developed indices. This comparison helped to shortlist indices that warranted further evaluation and accuracy assessment to identify effective indices for global inter-seasonal surface water extent mapping. Additional visual inspections were conducted for criteria that remained unresolved by the decision matrix to examine index consistency across the seasons in a wide range of geographic settings around the world, and further reduce the shortlist. An accuracy assessment was performed for three new shortlisted indices. On a global scale, CAWI (Comprehensive Automatic Water Index) was the best-performing index. Its distinct binary data distribution provides the possibility of regional automatic Otsu thresholding. CAWI was determined to be compatible for Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 sensors, providing the highest possible spatial resolution as well as the longest time series for retrospective analyses with freely available multispectral imagery. Two alternative indices were identified for sensors limited to the visible and NIR bands. The first index, CATWIC (Clear and Turbid Water Index Combination), split the classification of water into two components, with one index for generally clear water and another index for turbid water. The second, NDCHRWI (Normalized Difference Colourimetric High Resolution Water Index), applied the hue angle from a normalized difference RGB. Masking indices based on modified HSV Saturation equations were developed to reduce misclassification due to other high reflectance features. The indices' overall accuracies, respectively, were: 94.97%, 94.51%, and 94.85%. This study concludes with recommendations for the application of different indices for sensors possessing shortwave infrared bands and for sensors limited to the visible and NIR bands, with a simple stratification of six zones for Global Surface Water monitoring.

TI Modelling the impacts of land-use and drainage density on the water
   balance of a lowland-floodplain landscape in northeast Germany
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB This study presents the modelling approach and impact assessment of different strategies for managing wetland water resources and groundwater dynamics of landscapes which are characterised by the hydrological interactions of floodplains and the adjacent lowlands. The assessment of such impacts is based on the analysis of simulation results of complex scenarios of land-use changes and changes of the density of the drain age-network. The method has been applied to the 198 km(2) Lower Havel River catchment as a typical example of a lowland-floodplain landscape. The model used consists of a coupled soil water and groundwater model, where the latter one is additionally coupled to the surface channel network. Thus, the hydrological processes of the variable saturated soil zone as well as lateral groundwater flow and the interactions between surface water and groundwater are simulated in an integrated manner. The model was validated for several years of significantly different meteorological conditions. The comparison of lateral and vertical water balance components showed the dominance of lateral flow processes and the importance of the interactions between surface water and groundwater for the overall water balance and the hydrological state of that type of landscape.
   The simulation of land-use change scenarios showed only minor effects of land-use change on the water balance and groundwater recharge. Changes of groundwater recharge were particularly small within the wetland areas being part of the floodplain where interactions between surface water and groundwater are most pronounced. Alterations in vertical groundwater recharge were counter-balanced by the lateral interaction between groundwater and surface water. More significant deviations in groundwater recharge and storage were observed in the more peripheral areas towards the catchment boundaries which are characterised by greater groundwater distance from the surface and less intense of ground water-surface water interactions.
   However, the simulation results assuming a coarsening of the drainage network density showed the importance of drainage structure and geometry for the water balance: The removal of the artificial draining ditches in the floodplain would result in significant alterations of total groundwater recharge, i.e., less recharge from winter to early summer and an increase of groundwater recharge during summer and autumn. Furthermore the different effects of groundwater recharge alterations on the dynamics of groundwater stages within the wetland areas close to the floodplains compared to the more peripheral areas could be quantified. Finally, it will be discussed that a well-adjusted co-ordination of different management measures is required to reach a sustainable water resources management of such lowland-floodplain landscapes.

TI First evidence of microplastic pollution in the El Quetzalito sand beach
   of the Guatemalan Caribbean
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB In Guatemala, assessment of the impacts of microplastic pollution in marine and coastal protected areas has not yet been carried out. Therefore, the main goal of this paper was to evaluate the abundance, composition, physical forms, and the possible sources of plastic debris in the El Quetzalito Beach. The area was intended for biodiversity conservation but has been excessively contaminated by plastic materials from land-based activities. The results state that plastic debris negatively impact the Caribbean coast of Guatemala and are released by storm water and riverine transport from the Motagua River. With a high abundance of 279 items/m(2) (30 items/kg d.w.), composed mainly of polystyrene foam beads (66.8%) and polypropylene fragments (25.8%), the microplastic sources are the deterioration of large plastics. As these plastics are commonly used in industrial, commercial, fishing, and household activities, these findings reinforce the need to improve effective sustainable management actions of solid waste treatment and disposal in the Guatemalan cities.

TI Factors controlling the photochemical degradation of methylmercury in
   coastal and oceanic waters
SO MARINE CHEMISTRY
AB Many studies have recognized abiotic photochemical degradation as an important sink of methylmercury (CH3Hg) in sunlit surface waters, but the rate-controlling factors remain poorly understood. The overall objective of this study was to improve our understanding of the relative importance of photochemical reactions in the degradation of CH3Hg in surface waters across a variety of marine ecosystems by extending the range of water types studied. Experiments were conducted using surface water collected from coastal sites in Delaware, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Maine, as well as offshore sites on the New England continental shelf break, the equatorial Pacific, and the Arctic Ocean. Filtered water amended with additional CH3Hg at environmentally relevant concentrations was allowed to equilibrate with natural ligands before being exposed to natural sunlight. Water quality parameters - salinity, dissolved organic carbon, and nitrate - were measured, and specific UV absorbance was calculated as a proxy for dissolved aromatic carbon content. Degradation rate constants (0.87-1.67 day(-1)) varied by a factor of two across all water types tested despite varying characteristics, and did not correlate with initial CH3Hg concentrations or other environmental parameters. The rate constants in terms of cumulative photon flux values were comparable to, but at the high end of, the range of values reported in other studies. Further experiments investigating the controlling parameters of the reaction observed little effect of nitrate and chloride, and potential for bromide involvement. The HydroLight radiative transfer model was used to compute solar irradiance with depth in three representative water bodies - coastal wetland, estuary, and open ocean - allowing for the determination of water column integrated rates. Methylmercury loss per year due to photodegradation was also modeled across a range of latitudes from the Arctic to the Equator in the three model water types, resulting in an estimated global demethylation rate of 25.3 Mmol yr(-1). The loss of CH3Hg was greatest in the open ocean due to increased penetration of all wavelengths, especially the UV portion of the spectrum which has a greater ability to degrade CH3Hg. Overall, this study provides additional insights and information to better constrain the importance of photochemical degradation in the cycling of CH3Hg in marine surface waters and its transport from coastal waters to the open ocean.

TI Screening of organic chemicals in surface water of the North River by
   high resolution mass spectrometry
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Wide use of various chemicals has resulted in water pollution, which has become a global environmental concern. So far limited information is available on what chemicals in our water. Here we investigated the occurrence and profiles of organic chemicals in the North River, South China by applying non-target screening analysis with high resolution mass spectrometry. A total of 402 organic chemicals belonging to eleven categories were identified in the North River, with notable presence of industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals and pesticides. Among these detected chemicals, over half of the tentatively identified compounds were rarely reported in the surface water, with a few compounds, e.g., sisomicin, simeton, 2-methyl-4,6-dinitrophenol, xanthurenic acid and indole-3-carboxylic acid that have never been documented in the North River before, while the metabolites like 4-acetamidoantipyrine were also observed. The maximum concentration of the identified chemicals in the North River was above 300 ng/L (Sulfamonomethoxine). Principle component analysis results of the obtained dataset showed significant seasonal distribution, which could be linked to variations in wastewater discharge, river dilution and anthropogenic activities such as pesticide spray. Agricultural activities in the upper reaches led to detection of various pesticides in the river basin, especially in the wet season. The findings from this study demonstrated the widespread presence of chemicals in our waterway, and further retrospective analysis would reveal more information about chemicals of emerging concern.

TI The future of global water stress: An integrated assessment
SO EARTHS FUTURE
AB We assess the ability of global water systems, resolved at 282 assessment subregions (ASRs), to the meet water requirements under integrated projections of socioeconomic growth and climate change. We employ a water resource system (WRS) component embedded within the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Integrated Global System Model (IGSM) framework in a suite of simulations that consider a range of climate policies and regional hydroclimate changes out to 2050. For many developing nations, water demand increases due to population growth and economic activity have a much stronger effect on water stress than climate change. By 2050, economic growth and population change alone can lead to an additional 1.8 billion people living under at least moderate water stress, with 80% of these located in developing countries. Uncertain regional climate change can play a secondary role to either exacerbate or dampen the increase in water stress. The strongest climate impacts on water stress are observed in Africa, but strong impacts also occur over Europe, Southeast Asia, and North America. The combined effects of socioeconomic growth and uncertain climate change lead to a 1.0-1.3 billion increase of the world's 2050 projected population living with overly exploited water conditions-where total potential water requirements will consistently exceed surface water supply. This would imply that adaptive measures would be taken to meet these surface water shortfalls and include: water-use efficiency, reduced and/or redirected consumption, recurrent periods of water emergencies or curtailments, groundwater depletion, additional interbasin transfers, and overdraw from flow intended to maintain environmental requirements.

TI The use of stable isotopes to identify surface water-groundwater
   interaction in the Kruger National Park, South Africa
SO WATER SA
AB The role of groundwater, in general, is often overlooked in freshwater ecosystem management policies and in the management of South Africa's flagship conservation area, the Kruger National Park (KNP). To address this gap, a generalised conceptual model of surface water-ground water (sw-gw) interactions in the southern and central regions of the KNP was developed. To do this, stable isotope ratios (delta 18O and delta 2H) of groundwater, rainfall and surface water were used to determine the extent to which the base flow of perennial, seasonal and ephemeral streams on different geologies (granite vs. basalt) is driven by rainfall or groundwater. These results show that the delta 18O and delta 2H ratios of perennial rivers are similar to that of groundwater, while seasonal and ephemeral rivers on basalts have values closer to rainfall. On granite substrates, however, the isotope ratios of the seasonal and ephemeral rivers have values closer to groundwater than rainfall. The larger seasonal Mbyamiti River had similar isotope ratios to that of groundwater, and the highly ephemeral Nwaswitsontso had episodic interaction with groundwater (i.e. isotopic ratios overlap occasionally). These results show that decisions necessary for the sustainable management of groundwater resources are better informed when the natural interaction, movement, and exchange between groundwater and rivers are understood. This has particular relevance for large conservation areas in southern Africa that are expected to experience more variable climates in the future with both increases in drought and rainfall intensities.

TI The application of a groundwater/surface-water model to test the
   vulnerability of Bracciano Lake (near Rome, Italy) to climatic and
   water-use stresses
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Modelling tools are necessary for quantitative assessment of groundwater-dependent systems such as interacting groundwater aquifers and lakes. Numerical groundwater models supplemented by stream and lake submodels are the best available tools for testing the conceptual relation of surface water to groundwater, for identifying gaps in the amount and quality of data, and for better understanding the sustainability of a groundwater-lake system in the presence of stresses. Models are of particular interest when applied to an infrequently studied geological context that is subject to specific vulnerabilities and patterns of interaction. Volcanic lakes are one setting where flow models serve to extend current conceptual and practical understanding. In this study, a groundwater/surface-water flow model is presented for the flow-through Bracciano deep caldera lake located near Rome, Italy. The steady-state model quantifies and tests the existing conceptual understanding of the system by taking account of all sources and sinks, and by calibration of key parameters to head and flow data. A transient version of the model demonstrates the response of the system to dry and wet years and to anthropogenic stresses. Although precipitation is the dominant source of water overall for the lake, a major finding of this study is that the groundwater inflow to the lake can buffer fluctuations in lake-water level and reduce lake-level declines, especially during shorter periods of dry conditions.

TI Construction of the 500-m Resolution Daily Global Surface Water Change
   Database (2001-2016)
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB Surface water is the most dynamic land-cover type. Transitions between water and nonwater types (such as vegetation and ice) can happen momentarily. More frequent mapping is necessary to study the changing patterns of water. However, monitoring of long-term global water changes at high spatial resolution and in high temporal frequency is challenging. Here we report the generation of a daily global water map data set at 500-m resolution from 2001 to 2016 based on the daily reflectance time series from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. Each single-date image is classified into three types: water, ice/snow, and land. Following temporal consistency check and spatial-temporal interpolation for missing data, we conducted a series of validation of the water data set. The producer's accuracy and user's accuracy are 94.61% and 93.57%, respectively, when checked with classification results derived from 30-m resolution Landsat images. Both the producer's accuracy and user's accuracy reached better than 90% when compared with manually interpreted large-sized sample units (1,000mx1,000m) collected in a previous global land cover mapping project. Generally, the global inland water area reaches its maximum (similar to 3.80x10(6)km(2)) in September and minimum (similar to 1.50x10(6)km(2)) in February during an annual cycle. Short-duration water bodies, sea level rise effects, different types of rice field use can be detected from the daily water maps. The size distribution of global water bodies is also discussed from the perspective of the number of water bodies and the corresponding water area. In addition, the daily water maps can precisely reflect water freezing and help correct water areas with inconsistent cloud flags in the MOD09GA quality assessment layer.
   Plain Language Summary Daily global inland surface water maps are produced from more than 1.9 million frames of satellite images for the period of 2001-2016 with a spatial resolution of 500m. From this time series of maps, we found that the inland surface water on Earth varies greatly in area within an annual cycle. It can reach more than 3.8 million square kilometers in September and reduce to approximately 1.5 million square kilometers in February. We demonstrate that (1) short-duration water bodies in arid areas, which are particularly important to life, can be detected from these daily water maps; (2) sea level rise effects on land submersion can be detected over some gentle-slope coasts like west Florida; and (3) different types of rice field use exist in the world. For example, in California, United States, rice fields are filled with water after harvest to help create a wetland environment for wild birds in the winter.

TI Tracer hydrology of the data-scarce and heterogeneous Central American
   Isthmus
SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
AB Numerous socio-economic activities depend on the seasonal rainfall and groundwater recharge cycle across the Central American Isthmus. Population growth and unregulated land use changes resulted in extensive surface water pollution and a large dependency on groundwater resources. This work combines stable isotope variations in rainfall, surface water, and groundwater of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Honduras to develop a regionalized rainfall isoscape, isotopic lapse rates, spatial-temporal isotopic variations, and air mass back trajectories determining potential mean recharge elevations, moisture circulation patterns, and surface water-groundwater interactions. Intra-seasonal rainfall modes resulted in two isotopically depleted incursions (W-shaped isotopic pattern) during the wet season and two enriched pulses during the mid-summer drought and the months of the strongest trade winds. Notable isotopic sub-cloud fractionation and near-surface secondary evaporation were identified as common denominators within the Central American Dry Corridor. Groundwater and surface water isotope ratios depicted the strong orographic separation into the Caribbean and Pacific domains, mainly induced by the governing moisture transport from the Caribbean Sea, complex rainfall producing systems across the N-S mountain range, and the subsequent mixing with local evapotranspiration, and, to a lesser degree, the eastern Pacific Ocean fluxes. Groundwater recharge was characterized by (a) depleted recharge in highland areas (72.3%), (b) rapid recharge via preferential flow paths (13.1%), and enriched recharge due to near-surface secondary fractionation (14.6%). Median recharge elevation ranged from 1,104 to 1,979 m a.s.l. These results are intended to enhance forest conservation practices, inform water protection regulations, and facilitate water security and sustainability planning in the Central American Isthmus.

SO ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
CT Symposium on Water Resource Management
CY 2000
CL NICOSIA, CYPRUS
AB Many opportunities exist to take advantage of integrated surface water-groundwater management with consequent resource and investment savings. In inappropriate legal and administrative settings, groundwater becomes an open-access resource leading to excessive contemporary and inter-temporal externalities. Several policy instruments have been used to correct these externalities: limits in well spacing and capacities, pumping taxes and tradable pumping permits. Urban-agricultural competition for limited groundwater need not result in crises for either sector if these instruments are used to mediate the competition. In the case of non-renewable stocks of groundwater, rates of economic and demographic development should be planned in keeping with long-term criteria to avoid overly rapid exploitation of the resource, non-sustainable population levels and inappropriate investment in infrastructure. Island states and coastal areas have special problems related to saltwater intrusion and coastal subsidence that can be mitigated if not eliminated through the use of economic and physical measures. Five brief case studies illustrate these points.

TI A global meta-analysis of toxic metals in continental surface water
   bodies
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB The anthropogenic toxic metal dissemination in surface water resources is a major ecological and public health concern at diverse scales, from the regional to the global scale. However, in the scientific literature, a review dealing with distributions, pollution levels, potential sources and related health risks of toxic metals in surface water resources at the continental, country and global levels are missed. Conducting such a study will shed light on how the most recent investigations reveal that the average concentrations of iron (Fe), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr) and mercury (Hg) in Asia; Fe, Pb, Hg, Cr, cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), and arsenic (As) in Africa; As, Hg and Cr in Europe, and North, Central and South America are exceeding the drinking water permissible limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO), respectively. To achieve this goal, we analysed datasets belonging to 233 articles published from 2010 to 2022. After conducting a multivariate statistical analysis, our meta-analysis demonstrated both anthropogenic and natural sources were responsible for the high toxic metal concentrations. Moreover, health risk assessment findings showed that the hazard quotient (HQ) values of As and Pb for the ingestion pathway, and HQ value of Pb for the dermal pathway were greater than one (HQ>1) for all continents, thus leading to non-cancer health risks. The novelty of our findings suggests that necessary control measures and robust policies should be implemented urgently to prevent an increasing contamination load in surface water bodies, save natural ecosystem areas and reduce potential human health risks, not only at the regional or national level but also at the global scale.

TI Toxic cyanobacteria in water supply systems: data analysis to map global
   challenges and demonstrate the benefits of multi-barrier treatment
   approaches
SO H2OPEN JOURNAL
AB The occurrence of toxic cyanobacteria in surface waters and their impact on drinking water treatment plants (WTPs) is a growing, global concern. The main objective of this paper was to assess the presence of cyanobacteria in surface water sources and associated cell removal efficiency in full-scale WTPs across the world. Previously unpublished data was collected from WTPs experiencing cyanobacterial blooms in either their managed surface waters or recreational waters. In total, data were collected from 31 surface water sources and 21 WTPs in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The most commonly detected species were identified in both the surface waters, including Microcystis, Anabaena, Nostoc, Oscillatoria, and Planktolyngbya, and water treatment plant intakes, including Microcystis, Cylindrospermopsis, Anabaena, Pseudanabaena, and Aphanizomenon. In the intakes, cyanotoxins and taste and odor (T&O) compounds frequently co-occurred (80%) as did multiple cyanotoxins (39%). Conventional treatment saw a wide range of removal depending on the density of cells, species, and metabolites. Although more than 28% of sampling events displayed negligible or even negative removals of metabolites or cells due to accumulation within the clarifier, filtration, or water recycling, the presence of multiple treatment barriers, particularly advanced treatments like granular activated carbon and nanofiltration, allowed for the cells and their metabolites of concern to be removed to below guideline values. During treatment, total microcystins were often removed without releasing their intracellular fraction, whereas cylindrospermopsin, geosmin, and 2-MIB were commonly detected as entirely extracellular at the plant's intake. The maximum tolerable cell (MTC) counts for cyanotoxin- or T&O-producing cells were calculated using guideline values, average removal efficiency, and the average cell quota derived from data. The 21 WTPs in this work were found to be able to tolerate approximately 74,000 cells/mL for microcystins, 8,000 cells/mL for cylindrospermopsin, and 1,200 cells/mL for geosmin and 2-MIB before exceeding guideline values. These levels provide guidance for water treatment plant operators to assess the potential risk associated with cells capable of producing cyanotoxins or T&O compounds.

TI Hydrobiogechemical interactions in the hyporheic zone of a
   sulfate-impacted, freshwater stream and riparian wetland ecosystem
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS
AB Coupled abiotic and biotic processes in the hyporheic zone, where surface water and groundwater mix, play a critical role in the biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nutrients, and trace elements in streams and wetlands. Dynamic hydrologic conditions and anthropogenic pollution can impact redox gradients and biogeochemical response, although few studies examine the resulting hydrobiogeochemical interactions generated within the hyporheic zone. This study examines the effect of hyporheic flux dynamics and anthropogenic sulfate loading on the biogeochemistry of a riparian wetland and stream system. The hydrologic gradient as well as sediment, surface water, and porewater geochemistry chemistry was characterized at multiple points throughout the 2017 spring-summer-fall season at a sulfate-impacted stream flanked by wetlands in northern Minnesota. Results show that organic-rich sediments largely buffer the geochemical responses to brief or low magnitude changes in hydrologic gradient, but sustained or higher magnitude fluxes may variably alter the redox regime and, ultimately, the environmental geochemistry. This has implications for a changing climate that is expected to dramatically alter the hydrological cycle. Further, increased sulfate loading and dissolved or adsorbed ferric iron complexes in the hyporheic zone may induce a cryptic sulfur cycle linked to iron and carbon cycling, as indicated by the abundance of intermediate valence sulfur compounds (e.g., polysulfide, elemental sulfur, thiosulfate) throughout the anoxic wetland and stream-channel sediment column. The observed deviation from a classical redox tower coupled with potential changes in hydraulic gradient in these organic-rich wetland and stream hyporheic zones has implications for nutrient, trace element, and greenhouse gas fluxes into surface water and groundwater, ultimately influencing water quality and global climate.

TI Non-targeted screening of trace organic contaminants in surface waters
   by a multi-tool approach based on combinatorial analysis of tandem mass
   spectra and open access databases
SO TALANTA
AB Non-targeted screening (NTS) in mass spectrometry (MS) helps alleviate the shortcoming of targeted analysis such as missing the presence of concerning compounds that are not monitored and its lack of retrospective analysis to subsequently look for new contaminants. Most NTS workflows include high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS2) and structure annotation with libraries which are still limited. However, in silico combinatorial fragmentation tools that simulate MS2 spectra are available to help close the gap of missing compounds in empirical libraries. Three NTS tools were combined and used to detect and identify unknown contaminants at ultra-trace levels in surface waters in real samples in this qualitative study. Two of them were based on combinatorial fragmentation databases, MetFrag and the Similar Partition Searching algorithm (SPS), and the third, the Global Natural Products Social Networking (GNPS), was an ensemble of empirical databases. The three NTS tools were applied to the analysis of real samples from a local river. A total of 253 contaminants were identified by combining all three tools: 209 were assigned a probable structure and 44 were confirmed using reference standards. The two major classes of contaminants observed were pharmaceuticals and consumer product additives. Among the confirmed compounds, octylphenol ethoxylates, denatonium, irbesartan and telmisartan are reported for the first time in surface waters in Canada. The workflow presented in this work uses three highly complementary NTS tools and it is a powerful approach to help identify and strategically select contaminants and their transformation products for subsequent targeted analysis and uncover new trends in surface water contamination.

TI Detecting urban ecological land-cover structure using remotely sensed
   imagery: A multi-area study focusing on metropolitan inner cities
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB With increasing attention being paid to sustainable urban development and human habitation improvement, urban ecological land cover (UELC), i.e., surface water and green space, has played an important role of the highly compact inner urban regions. In this study, we dreltiped an efficient approach fin-UEL-C-mapping by coupling Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery and Google Earth high-resolution imagery. In contrast with the conventional single-source and multi-source imagery-based classification methods, the proposed method respectively achieved the highest overall accuracies of 91.50% and 94.05% in the UELC mapping for two test sites (i.e. Shanghai and Seoul). The proposed method is used for urban surface mapping among six world-class cities. For an in-depth analysis of the landscape structures for inner urban regions, seven landscape metrics are introduced for the quantification of the UELC structure based on the obtained high-precision UELC maps. The result shows that London appears to have the best UELC-induced ecological quality, that is, with high percentage of landscape, area-weighted mean fractal dimension, edge density, Shannon's evenness index values and a low contagion index value, while Tokyo is exactly the opposite. Several common characteristics found through the statistical analysis are: 1) all the inner-city regions have small UELC coverage (< 50%) and low shape complexity; 2) green space generally contributes more to urban eco-environment than the urban surface water; and 3) all cities show high landscape consistency in the inner urban region.

TI Water shortage risk assessment considering large-scale regional
   transfers: a copula-based uncertainty case study in Lunan, China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The risk of water shortage caused by uncertainties, such as frequent drought, varied precipitation, multiple water resources, and different water demands, brings new challenges to the water transfer projects. Uncertainties exist for transferring water and local surface water; therefore, the relationship between them should be thoroughly studied to prevent water shortage. For more effective water management, an uncertainty-based water shortage risk assessment model (UWSRAM) is developed to study the combined effect of multiple water resources and analyze the shortage degree under uncertainty. The UWSRAM combines copula-based Monte Carlo stochastic simulation and the chance-constrained programming-stochastic multiobjective optimization model, using the Lunan water-receiving area in China as an example. Statistical copula functions are employed to estimate the joint probability of available transferring water and local surface water and sampling from the multivariate probability distribution, which are used as inputs for the optimization model. The approach reveals the distribution of water shortage and is able to emphasize the importance of improving and updating transferring water and local surface water management, and examine their combined influence on water shortage risk assessment. The possible available water and shortages can be calculated applying the UWSRAM, also with the corresponding allocation measures under different water availability levels and violating probabilities. The UWSRAM is valuable for mastering the overall multi-water resource and water shortage degree, adapting to the uncertainty surrounding water resources, establishing effective water resource planning policies for managers and achieving sustainable development.

TI Assessment of exploitable groundwater resources of Denmark by use of
   ensemble resource indicators and a numerical groundwater-surface water
   model
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB The trend towards construction of comprehensive dynamical numerical groundwater-surface water models to facilitate the examination of the quantitative status of groundwater resources by means of indicators is growing. A typical resource indicator is the assumption that the maximum abstraction should not exceed the groundwater recharge to an aquifer. From an aquatic, ecological point of view, the recommendation is only to exploit a small fraction of the recharge, in order to allow a significant fraction to supply wetlands and river systems. The paper proposes a set of four resource indicators for translating qualitative policy considerations on sustainable groundwater developments into quantitative criteria that can be evaluated by use of comprehensive hydrological models: (1) Indicator 1 is equal to a maximum abstraction of 35% of the pre-abstraction recharge; (2) Indicator 2 assumes a maximum 30% utilisation of current recharge; (3) Indicator 3 is identified as the abstraction at which mean river runoff is reduced by a maximum 10%, compared to pre-abstraction runoff; and (4) Indicator 4 is the abstraction at which baseflow is reduced by a maximum 5%, 10%, 15%, 25% and 50% aggregated for the reaches with the same environmental goal (e.g. a maximum 10% reduction of baseflow for salmonid spawning and nursery waters compared to pre-abstraction baseflow). The methodology for the design of the four ensemble resource indicators is described and the results of applying those indicators are demonstrated for assessment of the regional and national exploitable groundwater resources of Denmark.

TI Pharmaceuticals in the Environment: Lessons Learned for Reducing
   Uncertainties in Environmental Risk Assessment
SO TOXICOLOGY AND HUMAN ENVIRONMENTS
SE Progress in Molecular Biology and Translational Science
AB Pharmaceuticals in the environment are often present at trace levels (e.g., ng/L) in surface waters and effluents of developed countries, yet represent contaminants of emerging concern. Attributes of many of these substances, such as potency, chirality, and ionization, present challenges to historical environmental risk assessment and management paradigms. In this chapter, we critically examine several important aspects of pharmaceuticals, specifically highlighting some of the lessons we have learned from studying these substances in the environment over the past 15 years. We submit that incorporating such "lessons learned" during environmental risk assessments promises to reduce uncertainties and support more sustainable management efforts.

TI Multivariate statistics and entropy theory for irrigation water quality
   and entropy-weighted index development in a subtropical urban river,
   Bangladesh
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Currently, a well-developed combination of irrigation water quality index (IWQIs) and entropy water quality index (EWQIs) for surface water appraisal in a polluted subtropical urban river is very scarce in the literature. To close this gap, we developed IWQIs by establishing statistics-based weights of variables recommended by FAO 29 standard value using the National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index (NSFWQI) compared with the proposed EWQIs based on information entropy in the Dhaleshwari River, Bangladesh. Fifty surface water samples were collected from five sampling locations during the dry and wet seasons and analyzed for sixteen variables. Principal component analysis (PCA), factor analysis (FA), Moran's spatial autocorrelation, and random forest (RF) model were employed in the datasets. Weights were allocated for primary variables to compute IWQI-1, 2 and EWQI-1, 2, respectively. The resultant IWQIs showed a similar trend with EWQIs and revealed poor to good quality water, with IWQI-1 for the dry season and IWQI-2 for the wet season is further suggested. The entropy theory recognized that Mg2+, Cr, TDS, and Cl- for the dry season and Cd, Cr, Cl-, and SO42- for the wet season are the major contaminants that affect irrigation water quality. The primary input variables were lessened to ultimately shortlisted ten variables, which revealed good performance in demonstrating water quality status since weights have come effectively from PCA than FA. The results of the RF model depict NO3-, Mg2+, and Cr as the most predominant variables influencing surface water quality. A significant dispersed pattern was detected for IWQImin-3 in the wet season (Moran's I>0). Overall, both IWQIs and EWQIs will generate water quality control cost-effective, completely objective to establish a scientific basis of sustainable water management in the study basin.

TI Spatial differentiation in stable isotope compositions of surface waters
   and its environmental significance in the Issyk-Kul Lake region of
   Central Asia
SO JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
AB Stable isotope values of oxygen (18O) and hydrogen (2H) of surface waters were used to study the origin and environmental significances in the Issyk-Kul basin of Kyrgyzstan in Central Asia, which is the most important intermountain basin in the modern Tien Shan orogen. This study is the first analysis of hydrochemical spatial differentiation in the stable isotopes of surface waters in this watershed. 75 samples were collected from rivers, springs, lakes, rain and snow during the rainy season in July and August of 2016. Stable isotopes of O-18 and H-2 were studied for all samples, and cation ratios (Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca) were also determined for lake water samples. Stable isotope values from precipitation scattered around the Local Meteoric Water Line (determined from Urumqi Station of the global network of isotopes in precipitation (GNIP)), together with values of the Deuterium excess parameter (d) from 15.3aEuro degrees to 30.5aEuro degrees, with an average of 19.8aEuro degrees, indicating that the moisture sources are primarily from regions with low relative humidity. The delta O-18 and delta H-2 values were significantly different between the river and lake samples, indicating that regional evaporation caused the isotopic enrichment of lake water. Geospatial autocorrelation, measured by Moran's I coefficient, indicated weak spatial autocorrelation within stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in the surface waters of the studied area, which is primarily an effect of climate during the water chemistry evolution. The cation ratios Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca in lake water samples were not correlated with the concentration of total dissolved solids, but did show correlation with stable isotopic values, which is significant for paleoenvironmental reconstruction.

TI Assessment of water quality and safety based on multi-statistical
   analyses of nutrients, biochemical indexes and heavy metals
SO JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY
AB The purpose of this research was to better understand the water quality status of the Xiangjiang River, China, and to evaluate the risks posed by the river water. Precisely, ten water quality parameters including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), Escherichia coli (E. coli), potassium permanganate index (CODMn), dichromate oxidizability (CODcr), five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), total phosphorus (TP) and fluoride (F-) as well as metal(loid)s (Pb, Hg, Cd, As, Zn, Cu and Se) were monitored monthly in 2016 at 12 sampling sites throughout the Hengyang section of the Xiangjiang River. Concentrations of all parameters were presented according to rainy and dry seasons. They were compared with Chinese surface water standards and WHO drinking water limits to assess the sustainability of the river water status. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed different pollution sources in different seasons. Dual hierarchical cluster analysis (DHCA) was applied to further classify the water quality variables and sampling sites. Besides, a risk assessment was introduced to evaluate the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic concerns of heavy metal(loid)s to human health. This research will help to optimize water monitoring locations and establish pollution reduction strategies on the preservation of public safety.

AB Environmental risk assessments for "down-the-drain" chemicals (e.g. pharmaceuticals and household product ingredients) are generally based on a comparison between predicted environmental concentration (PEC) and predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC) for a generic environment with a fixed dilution factor. For PEC calculations spatial and temporal variability is often not explicitly taken into account. In the absence of detailed local-scale information for specific point-sources, spatially-explicit approximations can be made, based on the ratio of available surface water and domestic water consumption. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed for predicting surface water dilution at a global scale. The approach employs 0.5 degrees resolution geographical data on national boundaries, population density, runoff (from water balance model calculations) and domestic water consumption to produce dilution factor maps for the global land surface. The proposed methodology has great potential for improving screening-level chemical risk assessments.

TI Fine-scale spatiotemporal variation in subsidence across California's
   San Joaquin Valley explained by groundwater demand
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Achieving sustainable agricultural groundwater use remains a significant challenge worldwide in part because data on groundwater withdrawals are limited. A new generation of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data provide high spatial- and temporal- resolution measurements of subsidence and uplift of the earth's surface, which are known to reflect change in groundwater storage below. Here, we establish for the first time a quantitative link between local irrigation water demand and InSAR-derived vertical land surface displacements in California's San Joaquin Valley, with the goal of increasing the utility of remotely sensed displacements for understanding and managing groundwater at fine scales. We relate 100 m, sub-monthly displacements to estimates of irrigation water demand generated from land cover and weather data by performing a suite of physical process-motivated statistical analyses that leverage (i) temporal variations in surface water supplies created by climate, and (ii) spatial variations in water demand created by different land uses. Between 2015 and 2017, cultivated land experienced up to seven times the total subsidence, and up to nine times the dry year subsidence rate, of uncultivated land. In uncultivated areas, subsidence rates differed minimally across dry and wet years. In contrast, within cultivated areas, dry year subsidence rates were more than double wet year rates, indicating increased agricultural groundwater pumping under diminished precipitation and surface water supplies. Mean subsidence, and the marginal response of subsidence to water demand, were greatest for cultivated lands and for field and pasture crops in particular, and were also proportional to distance from surface water supply infrastructure. These findings demonstrate that land surface observations have the potential for use in the quantification of connected surface water and groundwater processes at policy-relevant scales.

TI Indicators of improved water access in the context of schistosomiasis
   transmission in rural Eastern Region, Ghana
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Populations with poor access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure are disproportionately affected by the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). As a result, WASH has gained increasing prominence in integrated control and elimination of NTDs, including schistosomiasis. In order to identify underserved populations, relevant measures of access to WASH infrastructure at sub-national or local levels are needed. We conducted a field survey of all public water sources in 74 rural communities in the Eastern Region of Ghana and computed indicators of water access using two methods: one based on the design capacity and another on the spatial distribution of water sources. The spatial method was applied to improved and surface water sources. According to the spatial method, improved water sources in the study area were well-distributed within communities with 95% (CI95%: 91, 98) of the population having access within 500 m when all, and 87% (CI95%: 81, 93) when only functional water sources were considered. According to the design capacity-based method, indicator values were lower: 63% (CI95%: 57, 69) for all and 49% (CI95%: 43, 55) for only functional sources. Surfacewater access was sub-stantial with 62% (CI95%: 54, 71) of the population located within 500 m of a perennial surface water source. A negative relationship was observed between functional improved water access and surface water access within 300 m. In this context, perceived water quality of the improved sources was also important, with a 17% increase in surface water access in towns with one reported water quality problem as compared to towns with no problems. Our study offers a potential methodology to use water point mapping data to identify communities in need of improved water access to achieve schistosomiasis risk reduction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI Towards sustainable protection of public health: The role of an urban
   wetland as a frontline safeguard of pathogen and antibiotic resistance
   spread
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB Wetlands are known for providing important ecosystem services, such as reduction of eutrophication. However, less research has focused on public health service of wetlands: their ability to protect microbial quality of water for downstream while they attract wildlife populations. For urban surface water, transmission of antibiotic resistance is also an important concern. Under anticipated climate change scenarios, more extreme precipitation patterns are emerging. Thus, runoff and flooding from increased precipitation will impair surface water quality more significantly. The objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate the dynamics of bacteria of public health concern in urban wetlands, including: Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Arcobacter, and two antibiotic resistance genes (sulfonamide, sul1 and tetracycline, tetQ); and 2) identify the major fecal contamination sources using microbial source tracking (MST). Water samples were collected across the urban wetlands in central Ohio from June 2013 to June 2014 and tested with a culture-based (E. coli) and quantitative PCR (the rest) methods. Since Canada geese were the most observed wildlife at the study sites and they are known to carry an array of infectious disease agents, their fecal samples were also collected. From the water samples, E. coli (fecal indicator) had the highest occurrence in 99.2% of the total samples, followed by sul1 (98.3%), Arcobacter (94.9%), STEC (74.6%), tetQ (58.5%), and Campylobacter (1.7%). Overall reduction in E. coli was 22.3% across the wetlands, but variation was observed depending on the season. Microbial source tracking suggested a high prevalence of avian- (44.9%) and ruminant- (38.1%) originated fecal contaminations (e.g., Canada geese and deer). From the geese fecal samples, STEC (93.2%) and Arcobacter (4.5%) were detected, which could potentially compromise wetlands functions in reductions in bacteria of public health concern and antibiotic resistance. The results suggest that careful wildlife management together with long-term monitoring of microorganisms of concern are needed for making urban wetlands as a sustainable frontline safeguard of pathogen and antibiotic resistance spread in surface water.

TI Integration of target, suspect, and nontarget screening with risk
   modeling for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances prioritization in
   surface waters
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Though thousands of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been on the global market, most research focused on only a small fraction, potentially resulting in underestimated environmental risks. Here, we used complementary target, suspect, and nontarget screening for quantifying and identifying the target and nontarget PFAS, respectively, and developed a risk model considering their specific properties to prioritize the PFAS in surface waters. Thirty-three PFAS were identified in surface water in the Chaobai river, Beijing. The suspect and nontarget screening by Orbitrap displayed a sensitivity of > 77%, indicating its good performance in identifying the PFAS in samples. We used triple quadrupole (QqQ) under multiple-reaction monitoring for quantifying PFAS with authentic standards due to its potentially high sensitivity. To quantify the nontarget PFAS without authentic standards, we trained a random forest regression model which presented the differences up to only 2.7 times between measured and predicted response factors (RFs). The maximum/minimum RF in each PFAS class was as high as 1.2-10.0 in Orbitrap and 1.7-22.3 in QqQ. A risk-based prioritization approach was developed to rank the identified PFAS, and four PFAS (i.e., perfluorooctanoic acid, hydrogenated perfluorohexanoic acid, bistri-flimide, 6:2 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid) were flagged with high priority (risk index > 0.1) for remediation and management. Our study highlighted the importance of a quantification strategy during environmental scrutiny of PFAS, especially for nontarget PFAS without standards.

TI Lessons learned from Suds implementation at Peterborough, UK
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-CIVIL ENGINEERING
AB The Hampton mixed-used development south-west of Peterborough, UK was built largely on the brownfield site of a number of former brickworks. It was conceived around the need to manage surface water, which required creative thinking and a collaborative approach from the project team and key parties involved to realise delivery of a multi-functional surface water drainage strategy. The strategy was conceived prior to much of the sustainable drainage system (Suds) guidance and standards being produced, which are now considered commonplace. This paper looks at the development as a case study and assesses the lessons learned. To deliver Suds successfully, it is clear that comprehensive collaboration and communication are needed.

TI Arsenic contamination, subsequent water toxicity, and associated public
   health risks in the lower Indus plain, Sindh province, Pakistan
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Arsenic (As) contamination in drinking water is a global public health risk. The present study highlighted the geological and anthropogenic causes of As contamination in groundwater (GW) and surface water (SW) and assessment of their potential health risks in Sindh province of Pakistan. Upon analyzing 720 GW and SW samples from 18 different sites, the estimates of As in groundwater and surface water was observed in the range of 0 to 125 and 0 to 35 mu g/L with mean values of 46.8 and 15.43 mu g/L respectively. Majority of the samples exceeded WHO permissible limit of As (10 mu g/L) with higher concentration detected in groundwater samples compared to surface water. Moreover, both of these sample sources were found not potable based on physicochemical characteristics. The results of statistical analysis (correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and hierarchy cluster analysis (HCA)) indicate that natural mobilization of As in groundwater is believed to be enhanced by the pH-based reductive dissolution of iron hydroxide (FeOH) and competitive sorption of bicarbonate minerals in the presence of microorganisms along with evaporative enrichment while water logging, coal mining, and excessive use of pesticides are believed to be the anthropogenic causes of As enrichment. Furthermore, enormous health risk was associated with As in terms of chronic daily intake (CRI), hazard quotient (HQ), and cancer risk probability (CR) in GW and SW. Mean HQ values in GW were 4.47 mg/kg/day in adults and 3.89 mg/kg/day in children (standard HQ <= 1) and was 1.43 and 1.28 mg/kg/day in SW. Mean CR value in both GW and SW was found higher than the safe limit (10(-6)) having a mean of 2x10(-3) in GW and 7x10(-4) (mg/kg/day) in SW. These findings suggest that majority of the sampling sites carry serious public health risk due to high As values and hence demands exigent remedial and management measures.

TI Occurrence, distribution, and ecological risk of bisphenol analogues in
   marine ecosystem of urbanized coast and estuary
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB Bisphenol analogues are prevalent globally because of rampant usage and imprecise processing techniques, prompting alerts about environmental and health hazards. The method employed in this study by solid phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) for both quantification and qualitative analysis of the bisphenol compounds in the surface water samples. The coastal and estuarine surface water of Port Dickson and Lukut ranges from 1.32 ng/L to 1890.51 ng/L of bisphenol analogues. BPF mean concentration at 1143.88 ng/L is the highest, followed by BPA and BPS at 59.01 ng/L and 10.96 ng/L, respectively. Based on RQm for bisphenol analogues, the highest for BPF at 2.49 (RQ > 1, high risk), followed by BPS at 0.12 (0.1 < RQ < 1, medium risk) and BPA at 0.09 (0.1 < RQ < 1, medium risk). The presence and current risk of bisphenols analogues should alert the possible water quality degradation soon.

TI Distribution and risk assessment of banned and other current-use
   pesticides in surface and groundwaters consumed in an agricultural
   catchment dominated by cocoa crops in the Ankobra Basin, Ghana
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The existence of pesticides, such as organochlorine pesticides, parathion-ethyl, methamidophos which is banned globally and some current-use non-banned pesticides of organophosphorus and synthetic pyrethroids in freshwater sources is an ecological and public health concern in many countries, including Ghana. Prompted by this concern, the exposure levels and risk assessment of these pesticides to humans and non-target organisms via groundwater and surface water sources in an agricultural catchment dominated by cocoa crops in the Ankobra Basin, Ghana, were investigated. The individual concentrations of the banned pesticides in the surface water and groundwater samples varied from < LOD to 0.110 mu g/L and < LOD to 0.055 mu g/L, respectively, while the concentrations of the non-banned pesticides ranged from < LOD to 0.925 mu g/L and < LOD to 2 mu g/L, respectively. The mean concentrations of chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, p,p'-DDT and pirimiphos-methyl in some water sources exceeded the EU limit of 0.1 mu g/L. Some surface water sources were more contaminated with DDTs, endrin, dieldrin, methoxychlor, chlorpyrifos, and HCH isomers than were freshwater sources in river basins in some countries of the world. Chlorpyrifos, p,p'-DDT and methoxychlor were ubiquitous in both water sources. The hydrochemical and compositional profiles of the pesticides indicate that water-exchange and secondary porosities in the bedrock likely contributed to the occurrence of the pesticides in the water sources. The pesticides were of low risk to humans that consume the water, but considering the US EPA safe limit for carcinogenic effects of 10(-6), the high levels of DDTs, beta-HCH, and dieldrin in some of the surface water and groundwater sources may cause cancer in children or infants. The toxicity of pesticide mixtures to surface water non-target organisms decreased in the order of fish > Daphnia magna > algae. The pesticides in the water sources were anthropogenic in origin and recently used. DDT and HCH in the water were of technical-grade origin. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Evaluation of benchmarking indicators of Sanjay Sarovar Irrigation
   Project, India
SO SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB Water is most limiting factor in crop production especially in the areas where agriculture sustains on irrigation. The rapid urbanization and industrialization have greatly affected the overall water demand scenario. As a result, the gap between water demand and availability has been progressively increasing. The benchmarking results for the Sanjay Sarovar Irrigation Project reflect a low level of water delivery service and irrigation performance. In Sanjay Sarovar Irrigation Project, the annual project irrigation efficiency of 41% and annual field irrigation efficiency of 51% of irrigation requirement cannot fully meets the needs of sustainable development. Most of the key internal indicators covering operations and service are low. External indicators, such as irrigation efficiency, cost recovery ratio, and productivity, were also relatively low. Study suggests the immediate need to improve the service delivery of the surface water systems. This requirement to improve the surface water delivery systems is critical and should be the priority for projects.

AB Tampa Bay Water has been using deterministic optimization model to manage wellfield operations for its water supply system since January 1999. The model objective is to maintain the sustainability of the ecological resources, mainly wetlands and lakes, while satisfy the growing demands of portable water in the Northern Tampa Bay Region of Florida. The recent completion of the surface water enhancement project components added complexity into current management model due to the uncertainty nature of the new added supply sources. A new on-going project was initiated in 2003 to study the current model formulation and to develop a stochastic optimization approach for managing the integrated surface and ground water sources considering various uncertainty variables. These variables include forecasted water demands, projected, surface water availability, predicted groundwater responses by an integrated surface and ground water simulation model, and estimates precipitation and evaporation. rates from off-stream reservoir. This paper discusses some details on the modeling framework of this new reliability based water supply management model.

TI A comprehensive evaluation of microplastic pollution in the Xiangshan
   Bay of China with special reference to seasonal variation
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Marine microplastic (MP) pollution has drawn global attention due to its potential risk to ecosystem. In the present study, we investigated MP pollution in surface water and sediment of a semi-closed bay: the Xiangshan Bay in the East China Sea in spring and summer. The results showed that MP abundance in surface water increased significantly in summer than spring (0.233 and 0.036 item/m3, respectively), while MP abundance in sediment was relatively steady. Meanwhile, the smaller size MPs (diameter < 1000 mu m) and land-input fragment-shaped and film-shaped PP and PE increased in surface water in summer compared to spring. Surface microstructure of MPs showed that there were more cracks on MPs in summer comparing to spring. Based on diversity index, MP pollution in the Xiangshan Bay was at a low level and the composition was relatively uncomplicated. The source tracing analysis indicated main contributor of MPs were different in two seasons: textile industry was the dominate source of MPs in spring while fishery production were the dominate source in summer. Our results indicate that the pollution source of MPs could be various in different seasons due to the different climate and human activities, and provide a reference in the prevention and control of MP pollution in semi-closed bay ecosystems.

TI Assessment of plastic pollution in the Bohai Sea: Abundance,
   distribution, morphological characteristics and chemical components
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Plastics are globally distributed in oceans and can pose a threat to the environment and organisms. In this study, plastic pollution in surface water and sediments of the Bohai Sea was assessed based on plastic abundance, distribution and characteristics (shape, polymer, size and color). Water and sediment samples were collected across the sea using a plankton net (330 mm) and a grab sampler, respectively. The following conclusions were reached. 1) In surface water, large plastics were less abundant (0.14 items/m(3)) and showed less diverse characteristics than microplastics (0.79 items/m(3)) but did not significantly differ in spatial distribution. 2) Microplastics in water were more abundant (1.95 items/m(3)) with more diverse characteristics in Liaodong Bay than in other regions of the sea (0.26-0.59 items/m(3)). Plastic waste from highly concentrated agricultural, industrial and fishery activities could make large contributions to microplastics in Liaodong Bay. Additionally, low hydrodynamics and long distance to Bohai Strait are unfavorable for diffusion of particles, facilitating the retention of microplastics and increasing the abundance in this bay. 3) Microplastics in sediments were smaller in terms of dominant sizes (<0.5 mm) with less diverse characteristics than particles in water (0.5-1.5 mm). Specifically, fragments, foams and lines dominated among the microplastics in water, whereas fibers and fragments were dominant particles in sediments; alkyd resin, polyethylene, polystyrene and polypropylene (PP) predominated among the particles in water, but rayon, cellulose and PP were dominant particles in sediments. 4) Neither abundance nor size of microplastics in the two media was proportionally correlated and showed low similarity indexes of polymer (0.16), shape (0.29) or color (0.38). This could be related to mismatch in spatiotemporal distributions and variations in the characteristics, fate and behavior of microplastics in the two media. The findings provide knowledge for tracing the sources of plastics in the Bohai Sea. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Differential exposure, duration, and sensitivity of unionoidean bivalve
   life stages to environmental contaminants
SO JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY
AB Freshwater mussels (superfamily Unionoidea) are in serious global decline and in urgent need of protection and conservation. The declines have been attributed to a wide array of human activities resulting in pollution and water-quality degradation, and habitat destruction and alteration. Linkages among poor water quality, pollutant sources, and mussel decline in rivers and streams have been associated with results of laboratory-based tests of specific pollutants. However, uncertainties remain about the relationship of laboratory data to actual contaminant exposure routes for various mussel species, life stages, and in the habitats occupied during these exposures. We evaluated the pathways of exposure to environmental pollutants for all 4 life stages (free glochidia, encysted glochidia, juveniles, adults) of unionoidean mussels and found that each life stage has both common and. unique characteristics that contribute to observed differences in exposure and sensitivity. Free glochiclia typically are exposed only briefly (e.g., seconds to days) through surface water, whereas adults sustain exposure over years to decades through surface water, pore water, sediment, and diet. juveniles live largely burrowed in the sediment for the first 0 to 4 y of life. Thus, sediment, pore water, and diet are the predominant exposure routes for this life stage, but surface water also might contribute to exposure during certain periods and environmental conditions. The obligate parasitic stage (encysted glochidia stage) on a host fish might be exposed from surface water while partially encysted or from toxicants in host-fish tissue while fully encysted. Laboratory methods for testing for acute and chronic exposures in water have advanced, and toxicant-specific information has increased in recent years. However, additional research is needed to understand interactions of life history; habitat, and long-term exposure to contaminants through water, pore water, sediment, and diet so that the risks of environmental exposures can be properly assessed and managed.

TI Eco-environmental effects of water resources development and utilization
   in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY
AB Water resources development and utilization (WRDU) is an important way for humans to utilize natural resources, and has a deep effect on ecological environments. Flat topography, groundwater dependence and a high proportion of agricultural water are the main features of WRDU in Sanjiang Plain. Due to large-scale development in the last 60 years, the ecological environment of Sanjiang Plain has changed significantly. In order to identify the eco-environmental problems and make regional ecological environment and water resources sustainable, trend and correlation analyses were performed to analyze the eco-environmental effects of WRDU from the aspects of water resources, land resources, vegetation and climate. The results show that the regional eco-environmental effects caused by WRDU in Sanjiang Plain are significant. The quantity and quality of groundwater resources and the social and ecological functions of land resources are significantly affected by the regional development and utilization of water resources, while the effect of surface water resources is not obvious. The changes of vegetation and climate are also significant, but the response mechanism to WRDU requires further study. With the changes of extent, pattern and degree of surface water utilization in Sanjiang Plain, the effect of surface water resources is becoming more and more prominent.

SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Concentrations of 17 neuro-active pharmaceuticals and their major metabolites (bupropion, hydroxy-bupropion, erythro-hydrobupropion, threo-hydrobupropion, carbamazepine, 10,11,-dihydro-10,11,-dihydroxycarbamazepine, 10-hydroxy-carbamazepine, citalopram, N-desmethyl-citalopram, fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, 2-N-glucuronide-lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, venlafaxine and O-desmethyl-venlafaxine), were measured in treated wastewater and receiving surface waters from 24 locations across Minnesota, USA. The analysis of upstream and downstream sampling sites indicated that the wastewater treatment plants were the major source of the neuro-active pharmaceuticals and associated metabolites in surface waters of Minnesota. Concentrations of parent compound and the associated metabolite varied substantially between treatment plants (concentrations +/- standard deviation of the parent compound relative to its major metabolite) as illustrated by the following examples; bupropion and hydrobupropion 700 +/- 1000 ng L-1, 2100 +/- 1700 ng L-1, carbamazepine and 10-hydroxy-carbamazepine 480 +/- 380 ng L-1, 360 +/- 400 ng L-1, venlafaxine and O-desmethyl-venlafaxine 1400 +/- 1300 ng L-1, 1800 +/- 2300 ng L-1. Metabolites of the neuro-active compounds were commonly found at higher or comparable concentrations to the parent compounds in wastewater effluent and the receiving surface water. Neuro-active pharmaceuticals and associated metabolites were detected only sporadically in samples upstream from the effluent outfall. Metabolite to parent ratios were used to evaluate transformation, and we determined that ratios in wastewater were much lower than those reported in urine, indicating that the metabolites are relatively more labile than the parent compounds in the treatment plants and in receiving waters. The widespread occurrence of neuro-active pharmaceuticals and metabolites in Minnesota effluents and surface waters indicate that this is likely a global environmental issue, and further understanding of the environmental fate and impacts of these compounds is warranted.

AB Remote sensing data are nowadays being acquired within short intervals and made available at a low cost or for free. This opens up opportunities for new remote sensing applications, such as the characterization of entire regions to identify most suitable areas for technology targeting. Increasing population growth and changing dietary habits in South Asia call for higher cereal production to ensure future food security. In the Delta area of Bangladesh, surface water is considered to be available in quantities large enough to support intensification by adding an irrigated dry season crop. Fuel-efficient, low lift axial flow pumps have shown to be suitable to carry water to fields that are within a buffer of four hundred meters of the rivers. However, information on how and where to target surface water irrigation efforts is currently lacking. We describe the opportunities and constraints encountered in developing a procedure to identify cropland for which axial flow pumps could be successfully deployed upon in a 43'000 km2 area. First, we isolated cropland and waterways using Landsat 5 and 7 scenes using image segmentation followed by classification with the random forest algorithm. Based on Landsat 7 and 8 scenes, we extracted maximum dry season enhanced vegetation index ( EVI) values, which we classified into fallow, low-, and high-intensity cropland for the last three years. Last, we investigated the potential for surface water irrigation on fallow and low-intensity land by applying a cropping risk matrix to address the twin threats of soil and water salinity. Our analysis indicates that there are at least 20,000 ha of fallow land under the low-risk category, while more than 100,000 ha of low-intensity cropland can be brought into intensified production. This information will aid in technology targeting for the efficient deployment of surface water irrigation as a tool for intensification.

TI Combining multimedia models with integrated urban water system models
   for micropollutants
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Integrated urban water system (IUWS) modeling aims at assessing the quality of the surface water receiving the urban emissions through sewage treatment plants, combined sewer overflows (CSOS) and stormwater drainage systems However, some micropollutants tend to appear in more than one environmental medium (air, water, sediment, soil, groundwater, etc) In this work, a multimedia fate and transport model (MFTM) is "wrapped around" a dynamic IUWS model for organic micropollutants to enable integrated environmental assessment The combined model was tested on a hypothetical catchment using two scenarios on the one hand a reference scenario with a combined sewerage system and on the other hand a stormwater infiltration pond scenario, as an example of a sustainable urban drainage system (SUDS) A case for Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was simulated and resulted in reduced surface water concentrations for the latter scenario However, the model also showed that this was at the expense of increased fluxes to air, groundwater and infiltration pond soil The latter effects are generally not included in IUWS models, whereas MTFMs usually do not consider dynamic surface water concentrations hence the combined model approach provides a better basis for integrated environmental assessment of micropollutants' fate in urban environments

TI Combining Spectral Water Indices and Mathematical Morphology to Evaluate
   Surface Water Extraction in Taiwan
SO WATER
AB Rivers in Taiwan are characterised by steep slopes and high sediment concentrations. Moreover, with global climate change, the dynamics of channel meandering have become complicated and frequent. The primary task of river governance and disaster prevention is to analyse river changes. Spectral water indices are mostly used for surface water estimation, which separates the water from the background based on a threshold value, but it can be challenging in the case of environmental noise. Edge detection uses a canny edge detector and mathematical morphology for extracting geometrical features from the image and effective edge detection. This study combined spectral water indices and mathematical morphology to capture water bodies based on downloaded remote sensing images. From the findings, this study summarised the applicability of various spectral water body indices to the surface water extraction of different river channel patterns in Taiwan. The normalised difference water index and the modified normalised difference water index are suitable for braided rivers, whereas the automated water extraction index is ideal for meandering rivers.

AB Water quality changes of surface waters can be used to assess human impact intensity, but of importance is to consider also impacts of climate change/variability and naturally occurring changes of environmental quality. In Latvia, during the recent decades a major reduction of anthropogenic pressure has happened due to restructuring of economy and industrial production, resulting in major decrease of loading of many groups of pollutants. However, trends and driving factors for other groups of substances have not been much studied. Long term (1980-2012) results of hydrochemical monitoring, performed in rivers of Latvia, are analysed during this study in connection with long-term sets of hydrological and heliophysical data, using standard statistical approaches. Our results indicate that variation of some hydrochemical values, for example COD and total Fe, show clearly visible decadal oscillated character, while variation of some other values, for example phosphate P and total P, show some individual characteristics of decadal oscillations. These results indicate the presence of a large scale, geochemical and geophysical significant process: multiannual pulse of catchment, driven by variation of solar irradiance through complex interactions between global atmospheric circulation, groundwater and surface waterbodies. The process described in our study is significant from a geochemical point of view and must be taken into account in prediction of water quality and quantity. Impacts of natural processes should be considered in the planning of environmental policy.

TI Homogeneous environmental selection dominates microbial community
   assembly in the oligotrophic South Pacific Gyre
SO MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB Oligotrophic subtropical gyres are the largest continuous biomes on Earth and play a key role in global biogeochemical cycles. Microbial communities govern primary production and carbon cycling in the oligotrophic South Pacific Gyre, yet the ecological processes which underpin microbial biogeography in the region remain understudied. We investigated microbial biogeography and community assembly processes at three depths over a similar to 2,000-km the transect was longitudinal, so ran from 32 degrees S, 170 degrees W to 32 degrees S, 152 degrees W). Thus the latitude (32 degrees S) was constant. Microbial communities in the surface waters (15 and 50 m) were remarkably similar across the transect, whilst communities at the deep chlorophyll maximum were distinct from the surface waters and displayed greater compositional heterogeneity. An ecological null model approach indicated that homogeneous selection was the dominant community assembly process in both the surface waters (100%) and at the deep chlorophyll maximum (91.81%), although variable selection (2.34%) and stochastic processes (5.85%) had a minor influence at the deep chlorophyll maximum. Homogeneous selection (76.69%77.90%), dispersal limitation (15.00%-20.05%) and variable selection (3.01%-7.11%) influenced community assembly between the surface waters and the deep chlorophyll maximum. Seawater density and temperature, which were correlated, were the most important environmental modulators of the balance between stochastic and deterministic assembly processes. Our findings demonstrate remarkable similarity in microbial community composition across longitudinal scales in the oligotrophic South Pacific Gyre, underpinned by strong environmental selection which overwhelms the influence of ecological drift. These data significantly advance our understanding of microbial community dynamics in the oligotrophic subtropical gyres which dominate the Earth's surface.

TI Water source utilization under differing surface flow regimes in the
   riparian speciesLiquidambar styraciflua, in the southern Appalachian
   foothills, USA
SO PLANT ECOLOGY
AB Studies across the United States and globally have revealed that mature riparian trees often utilize little streamwater, relying on soil moisture and groundwater instead. Contrastingly, riparian plants growing in wetland systems in the southeastern US use greater proportions of swamp water. The purpose of the present study was to determine if plant water uptake was linked to surface flow regime of the riparian system, characterized by stream flow and standing pond water nearby. Water sources ofLiquidambar styracifluagrowing along Whetstone Creek, a perennial stream in Stoneville, NC, were determined and compared to those of individuals growing along adjacent spring-fed ponds by analyzing stable isotopic compositions of plant water. Plant water status and environmental variables were also monitored due to possible influences on the specific water sources accessed. It was expected that pondside individuals, due to the lower flow rate and increased pond water availability, would utilize a greater amount of surface water than groundwater, which is shallow at the site, compared to streamside trees. However, trees at both sites appeared to rely about equally on shallow soil and surface water, while groundwater contributed only a minor proportion to trees at both sites. There were no meaningful relationships between the water sources measured and environmental factors, and plant water status was consistently high for trees at both sites. The current study is one of the first to demonstrate quantitatively a strong reliance on surface water by mature riparian trees in the southeastern US.

TI Exploring competitiveness of surface water versus ground water
   irrigation and their impacts on rice productivity and efficiency: An
   empirical analysis from Bangladesh
SO AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB The choice of irrigation water sources is crucial in rice farming as water availability and cost can vary across water sources. Groundwater caters three-quarters of the total irrigated land in Bangladesh, where rice area alone occupies 80% of the total irrigated land. The present study compares productivity and efficiency differences and determinants of surface and groundwater irrigation users based on a sample of 6947 dry-winter rice growing plots from the nationally representative Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey-2018 database. A range of methods was adopted to correct for heterogeneity in irrigation water source choice decision, self-selection and observable biases. This involved an estimation of a Stochastic Production Frontier (SPF) model with the pooled sample first, then an application of Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to remove self-selection and observable biases, then a test of heterogeneity in irrigation source choices was conducted, and finally estimated two SPF separately for matched samples of groundwater and surface water irrigation users. Results revealed a robust effect of groundwater irrigation in enhancing rice productivity and efficiency. Seed and its quality, fertilizer and soil type are also significant drivers of rice productivity. The significant drivers of efficiency are plot ownership, irrigation frequency, subsidy and family size. Large farms with groundwater-irrigated plots are relatively more efficient. Significantly lower efficiency exists in areas vulnerable to drought. These results raise sustainability concerns owing to the high level of groundwater extraction and falling water table. Policymakers need to devise innovative strategies to increase use of surface water irrigation without sacrificing productivity and efficiency, which has been a priority policy drive in Bangladesh.

AB Phosphorus is a chemical substance and is a kind of nutrient that is essential for the growth of the organism. This key element tends to be growth-limiting-nutrient in lake ecosystems. The high concentration of phosphorus is toxic and can cause a major effect on the water body. Excessive nutrients may lead to eutrophication which will cause the depletion of oxygen. The anoxic waters would reduce the water quality of the surface water and disrupt the stability of the ecosystem. Thus, it is important to measure the phosphorus in a surface water system and to limit the amount of phosphorus going into the water body. Thus, this research aims to evaluate the phosphorus reduction using seed sludge taken from wastewater treatment in Kolej Mawar, UiTM, Shah Alam, Selangor. In the wastewater, biological phosphorus removal (BPR or Bio-P) or the enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) is the biological process where this substance is incorporated into cell biomass and subsequently removed from the process as a result of sludge wasting. Here, seed sludge from wastewater was used in a batch culture experiment using two different solutions of disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4) and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (K2HPO4) in a synthetic medium. The phosphorus reduction and the percentage removal were observed in these two solutions in one-week incubation time. It can be observed that the percentage removal of phosphorus in Na2HPO4 solution was higher (88% and 96%) compared to K2HPO4 solutions (70% and 29%). From the results obtained, the phosphorus can significantly be reduced using the seed sludge from the wastewater in short incubation time within one week. Thus, a sustainable approach in green technology can be further investigated and enhanced to overcome the environmental problems in reducing the phosphorus effluent discharge into the surface water system.

TI Implications of biomass production and accountability for "water
   grabbing"
SO SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING MANAGEMENT AND POLICY JOURNAL
AB Purpose - This paper aims to provide a view on the implications of large-scale increases in demand for biomass production on water storage behaviours. In climates of high variability in rainfall, the pressures on farmers to build up on-farm surface water supplies to the detriment of communities and businesses downstream is already present. Therefore, the added water storage pressures that arise from future demands for biomass need to be investigated.
   Design/methodology/approach - This viewpoint presents a review of the issues surrounding the forecast for demand for agriculturally produced biomass and the increased demands on surface water storage created. The paper then presents the problem of unfair and unsafe water storage in agriculture through a review of the surrounding literature and policy in place in Australia.
   Findings - The paper finds that if predicted skyrocketing future demand for biomass production for energy eventuates, then surface water on-farm storages would be placed at increased risk as farmers experience pressure to store more water than they are entitled to. Increased demands from biomass production could mean that surrounding communities suffer increased threat from unfair water sharing in times of drought, and unsafe water storage in times of flood.
   Practical implications - Policy should be developed rapidly to address the current unsustainable water storage management practices of farmers and sustainable biomass production. Water management behaviour certification should be introduced immediately to counter the risk of over storage in light of the demands of the future.
   Originality/value - The paper provides an overview of the issues surrounding unfair and unsafe on farm water storage in dams in climate extremes placed in the context of a new and emerging demand on farmers to produce in an unsustainable manner.

TI Statewide Effects of Ending Long-Term Groundwater Overdraft in
   California
SO JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Groundwater overdraft is a major problem globally and has been a growing problem for California for decades. This overdraft is predominantly driven by the economic value of water for agricultural production and cities. Spurred by the recent drought, California passed legislation requiring the elimination of groundwater overdraft by 2040. This paper employs a statewide hydroeconomic optimization model to explore potential water supply effects of ending long-term groundwater overdraft in California's Central Valley for several general water policies with historical and warmer-drier climates. The model minimizes agricultural, urban scarcity, and operating costs over 82 years of historical hydrologic variability, given today's infrastructure and environmental flow constraints. The model results assess effects of overdraft and Delta policies for different climates on water deliveries, economic costs, environmental flows, water market operations, and the economic value of expanding infrastructure capacities. Prohibiting long-term overdraft leads to reduced agricultural water use and reoperations, and reduced outflows to the sea from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, where water availability policies become important. In combination with a warmer-drier climate, ending overdraft further exacerbates water scarcities, increases environmental and economic costs, and increases the marginal economic value of water exports from the Delta, which are likely to worsen water conflicts and illustrate connections of California's groundwater and surface water problems. Economically useful adaptation actions include more water transfers involving the Delta, water markets, and trades; conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater; and recycled wastewater supplies for coastal urban users.

TI Water accounting for conjunctive groundwater/surface water management:
   case of the Singkarak-Ombilin River basin, Indonesia
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB Because water shortages limit development in many parts of the world, a systematic approach is needed to use water more productively. To address this need, Molden and Sakthivadivel [Water Resour. Dev. 15 (1999) 55-71] developed a water-accounting procedure for analyzing water use patterns and tradeoffs between users. Their procedure treats groundwater and surface water as a single domain. We adapted this procedure to account for groundwater and surface water components separately, and applied the adapted procedure to the Singkarak-Ombilin River basin, Indonesia, where groundwater is a significant part of the overall water balance. Since 1998, a substantial proportion of water has been withdrawn from Singkarak Lake and diverted out of the basin, resulting in significant impacts on downstream water users and the lake ecosystem. Based on 15-20 years (1980- 1999) of hydrometeorological, land use, soil, and other relevant data, a simple groundwater balance model was developed to generate the hydrogeologic information needed for the water-accounting procedure. The water-accounting procedure was then used to evaluate present and potential future water use performance in the basin. By considering groundwater and surface water components separately, a more realistic estimate of water availability was calculated than could be obtained by lumping these components together. Results show that the diversion of 37 m(3)/s from Singkarak Lake increases the amount of water that is not available for other uses. such as for irrigation, from 57-81 to 81 -95% of total water available in the basin. The new water accounting procedure also demonstrates the viability of increasing downstream water supply and water use performance during the dry months (June -September). For example, by increasing irrigation during the wet months (January-April) or tapping water from a shallow, unconfined aquifer during the dry months, while keep maintaining sustainable groundwater levels.

TI Surface Water and Groundwater Interactions in Wetlands
SO JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCE
AB Wetland ecosystems are critical habitats for various types of wild lives and are important components of global ecosystem. However, with climate change and human activities, wetlands are facing with degradation. Surface water and groundwater (SW-GW) interactions play an essential role in matter and energy cycling in wetlands, and therefore affect the evolution and health of wetlands. But the role of groundwater in wetland ecosystems has been neglected or simplified. In this paper, we reviewed how surface water interacts with groundwater, and made a systematic summarization of the role of SW-GW interactions (such as maintaining water balance and biological diversity and removing pollution) in wetland ecological functions. We also reviewed the methods to investigate, simulate and quantify SW-GW interactions and related reactions. Finally, we illustrated how climate change and human activities affect SW-GW interactions and therefore affect wetland functions. We highlight the importance of groundwater in wetlands and the urgency to intensify the research in integrated multidisciplinary monitoring and simulation methods, dominant variables and thresholds and integrated water resources management of SW-GW interactions, and further aim to stimulate better protection and restoration of wetlands all over the world.

TI Smart SUDS: recognising the multiple-benefit potential of sustainable
   surface water management systems
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB How can we make sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) smart? SUDS help us to manage surface water runoff from urban environments but they are capable of delivering much more. This paper looks beyond the water quantity and quality improvement functions of SUDS and investigates the multiple benefits that can be gained by implementing smart SUDS solutions. This work provides a new perspective, using methodologies not normally associated with SUDS research, to determine multiple benefits. The outputs of the work can potentially assist decision-makers, designer and planners in recognising the potential for multiple benefits that can be delivered by SUDS. The ecosystem services (ES) associated with a large redevelopment in Dundee, Scotland, UK, are identified and a public perception study together with public participatory geographical information system (PPGIS) methods was used to confirm the goods and benefits of the SUDS. The paper presents findings on the public perception of SUDS as they provide cultural benefits such as recreation, aesthetics and biodiversity. The results show that greenspace is important when choosing a location, and willingness to pay for greenspace is high in this area. This paper concludes that SUDS provide multi-functional benefits in relation to the ES, thereby justifying the cachet of being termed Smart SUDS.

TI Groundwater irrigation and its implications for water policy in semiarid
   countries: the Spanish experience
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Over the last decades, groundwater irrigation has become commonplace in many arid and semiarid regions worldwide, including Spain. This is largely a consequence of the advances in drilling and pumping technologies, and of the development of Hydrogeology. Compared with traditional surface water irrigation systems, groundwater irrigation offers more reliable supplies, lesser vulnerability to droughts, and ready accessibility for individual users. Economic forces influence the groundwater irrigation sector and its development. In Spain's Mediterranean regions, abstraction costs often amount to a very small fraction of the value of crops. In the inner areas, groundwater irrigation supports a more stable flow of farm income than rainfed agriculture. The social (jobs/m(3)) and economic (Euro/m(3)) value of groundwater irrigation generally exceeds that of surface water irrigation systems. However, poor groundwater management and legal controversies are currently at the base of Spain's social disputes over water. A thorough and transparent assessment of the relative socio-economic value of groundwater in relation to surface water irrigation might contribute to mitigate or avoid potential future conflicts. Enforcement of the European Union's Water Framework Directive may deliver better groundwater governance and a more sustainable use.

TI The Arctic Ocean marine carbon cycle: evaluation of air-sea CO2
   exchanges, ocean acidification impacts and potential feedbacks
SO BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB At present, although seasonal sea-ice cover mitigates atmosphere-ocean gas exchange, the Arctic Ocean takes up carbon dioxide (CO2) on the order of -66 to -199 TgC year(-1) (10(12) gC), contributing 5-14% to the global balance of CO2 sinks and sources. Because of this, the Arctic Ocean has an important influence on the global carbon cycle, with the marine carbon cycle and atmosphere-ocean CO2 exchanges sensitive to Arctic Ocean and global climate change feedbacks. In the near-term, further sea-ice loss and increases in phytoplankton growth rates are expected to increase the uptake of CO2 by Arctic Ocean surface waters, although mitigated somewhat by surface warming in the Arctic. Thus, the capacity of the Arctic Ocean to uptake CO2 is expected to alter in response to environmental changes driven largely by climate. These changes are likely to continue to modify the physics, biogeochemistry, and ecology of the Arctic Ocean in ways that are not yet fully understood. In surface waters, sea-ice melt, river runoff, cooling and uptake of CO2 through air-sea gas exchange combine to decrease the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) mineral saturation states (Omega) of seawater while seasonal phytoplankton primary production (PP) mitigates this effect. Biological amplification of ocean acidification effects in subsurface waters, due to the remineralization of organic matter, is likely to reduce the ability of many species to produce CaCO3 shells or tests with profound implications for Arctic marine ecosystems

TI Application of metagenomics to assess microbial communities in water and
   other environmental matrices
SO JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
AB The emergence of metagenomics-based approaches in biology has overcome historical culture-based biases in microbiological studies. This has also enabled a more comprehensive assessment of the microbial ecology of environmental samples. The subsequent development of next-generation sequencing technologies, able to produce hundreds of millions of sequences at improved cost and speed, necessitated a computational shift from user-supervised alignment and analysis pipelines, that were used previously for vector-based metagenomic studies that relied on Sanger sequencing. Current computational advances have expanded the scope of microbial biogeography studies and offered novel insights into microbial responses to environmental variation and anthropogenic inputs into ecosystems. However, new biostatistical and computational approaches are required to handle the large volume and complexity of these new multivariate datasets. While this has allowed more complete characterization of taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional microbial diversity, these tools are still limited by methodological biases, incomplete databases, and the high cost of fully characterizing environmental biodiversity. This review addresses the evolution of methods to monitor surface waters and characterize environmental samples through the recent computational advances in metagenomics, with an emphasis on the study of surface waters. These new methods have provided an abundance of opportunities to expand our understanding of the interaction between microbial communities and public health. Specifically, they have allowed for comprehensive monitoring of bacterial communities in surface waters for changes in community structure associated with faecal contamination and the presence of human pathogens, rather than relying on only a few indicator bacteria to direct public health concerns.

TI Sources of water pollution and evolution of water quality in the Wuwei
   basin of Shiyang river, Northwest China
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Based on surveys and chemical analyses, we performed a case study of the surface water and groundwater quality in the Wuwei basin, in order to understand the sources of water pollution and the evolution of water quality in Shiyang river. Concentrations of major chemical elements in the surface water were related to the distance downstream from the source of the river, with surface water in the upstream reaches of good quality, but the river from Wuwei city to the Hongya reservoir was seriously polluted, with a synthetic pollution index of 25. Groundwater quality was generally good in the piedmont with dominant bicarbonate and calcium ions, but salinity was high and nitrate pollution occurs in the northern part of the basin. Mineralization of the groundwater has changed rapidly during the past 20 years. There are 23 wastewater outlets that discharge a total of 22.4 x 10(6) m(3) y(-1) into the river from Wuwei city, which, combined with a reduction of inflow water, were found to be the major causes of water pollution. Development of fisheries in the Hongya reservoir since 2000 has also contributed to the pollution. The consumption of water must be decreased until it reaches the sustainable level permitted by the available resources in the whole basin, and discharge of wastes must also be drastically reduced.

TI Water Circulation and Marine Environment in the Antarctic Traced by
   Speciation of I-129 and I-127
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Emissions of anthropogenic I-129 from human nuclear activities are now detected in the surface water of the Antarctic seas. Surface seawater samples from the Drake Passage, Bellingshausen, Amundsen, and Ross Seas were analyzed for total I-129 and I-127, as well as for iodide and iodate of these two isotopes. The variability of I-127 and I-129 concentrations and their species (I-127(-)/(IO3-)-I-127, I-129(-)/(IO3-)-I-129) suggest limited environmental impact where ((1.15-3.15) x 10(6) atoms/L for I-129 concentration and (0.61-1.98) x 10(-11) for I-129/I-127 atomic ratios are the lowest ones compared to the other oceans. The iodine distribution patterns provide useful information on surface water transport and mixing that are vital for better understanding of the Southern Oceans effects on the global climate change. The results indicate multiple spatial interactions between the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and Antarctic Peninsula Coastal Current (APCC). These interactions happen in restricted circulation pathways that may partly relate to glacial melting and icebergs transport. Biological activity during the warm season should be one of the key factors controlling the reduction of iodate in the coastal water in the Antarctic.

TI Saltwater intrusion into groundwater systems in the Mekong Delta and
   links to global change
SO ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH
AB In recent decades, changes in temperature, wind, and rainfall patterns of Southeast Asia induced by climate warming in the Tibetan Plateau result in many environmental changes that have serious impacts on the lower reach of the Mekong River basin, a region already battling severe water-related environmental problems such as pollution, saltwater intrusion, and intensified flooding. In the densely populated Mekong Delta located at the mouth of the Mekong River basin in southern Vietnam, the hydrogeological systems have been transformed from an almost undisturbed to a human-impacted state and saltwater intrusion into surface water and groundwater systems has grown to be a detrimental issue recently, seriously threatening freshwater supply and degrading the eco-environment. In this article, the impacts of human activities and climate change (e.g., groundwater over-exploitation, relative sea-level rise, storm surge, changing precipitation and temperature regimes, uncontrolled drainage canals, operation of hydropower dams, and rapid development of aquaculture) on saltwater intrusion into groundwater systems in the Mekong Delta are briefly reviewed. Based on current status of research findings regarding saltwater intrusion and the subsequent groundwater quality degradation under the impacts of human activities and climate change, major knowledge gaps and challenges are identified and discussed, including thickness and permeability of the silt and clay aquitard, present-day highly heterogeneous 3D distribution of saline groundwater zones, dynamic variation of saltwater/freshwater transition zone, and the most effective and economical control measure. To bridge these gaps, future work should: 1) apply environmental isotope techniques in combination with borehole tests to gain detailed hydrogeological information regarding spatial variation of permeability and thickness of the silt and clay aquitard; 2) intensify regular groundwater monitoring and collect as much groundwater samples from multiple hydro-stratigraphic units at different depths as possible to visualize the present-day highly heterogeneous 3D distribution of saline groundwater; 3) develop a series of variable-density coupled groundwater flow and salt transport models representing various scenarios of human activities and climate change for predicting future extent of saltwater intrusion; and 4) identify the dominant factor causing saltwater intrusion and determine the most effective and economical engineering technique to address saltwater intrusion problems in the Mekong Delta.

TI Surface water and groundwater dynamic interaction models as guiding
   tools for optimal conjunctive water use policies in the central plain of
   Thailand
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
AB Many irrigation projects in the central plain of Thailand are not capable of providing sufficient surface water for the cultivation of rice, which is the major cash crop for Thai farmers. To overcome this surface water deficiency, which has been exacerbated in recent years by climate change, groundwater is increasingly being used for irrigation. Thus, large sections of agriculture lands have been converted to conjunctive water use regions. While conjunctive water use may be a suitable option to overcome the temporary water shortages on a short-term basis, it may pose a particular threat to the overall water resources in the long term, if not properly managed. As a remedy, conjunctive water management policies ought to be adopted. Conjunctive water management is basically a tool to optimize productivity, equity, and environmental sustainability through simultaneous management of surface water and groundwater resources. As of now, such a comprehensive approach has not been yet employed in the upper Chao Phraya basin of Thailand, and the present study is one of the first of this kind. The study region is the Plaichumpol Irrigation Project (PIP) where conjunctive water use has become indispensable for meeting the increasing water requirements for farming. To get a first grip on the issue, water demand, supply and actual use in the study area were investigated for the purpose of providing possible guidelines for optimal water exploitation. A numerical groundwater model with a special module for simulating surface-groundwater interaction was applied in the PIP area to understand the impact of the farmer's irrigation behavior on the dominant hydrological processes that determine the seasonal and multi-annual water availability in the irrigation area. A set-up of different agricultural water allocation schemes that depend on the local weather conditions and the regional management rules are examined by the numerical models. The results of the simulations provide adaptation guidelines for the proper management of the conjunctive water resources, namely, optimal water utilization. The numerical results for the surface groundwater in particular indicated that while the irrigation canals recharge water to the aquifer during both dry and wet season, small amounts of discharge from the aquifers to the canals occur only during the wet season. The analysis of the groundwater balance also showed that the present available groundwater potential is not fully exploited by the farmers, especially during the dry periods of surface water shortage. In contrast, the adoption of an optimal conjunctive management scheme would ensure extra water availability for additional annual rice crops in the region.

TI How sawmill wastes impact surface water, sediment, macrobenthic
   invertebrates, and fish: a case study of the Lagos lagoon, Okobaba Area,
   South-western Nigeria
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB The Okobaba area of the Lagos Lagoon, Nigeria, is characterised by sawmilling activities which are potential threats to resident aquatic organisms. This study was aimed at evaluating the effect of sawmilling activities on the environmental quality of the Lagos lagoon at Okobaba area, Lagos, Nigeria. Surface water, sediment, macrobenthic invertebrates, and fish species were sampled monthly from six stations for 3 months (July-September 2018). Relevant stakeholders were administered a cross-sectional questionnaire to determine their knowledge of the environmental effects of their activities. Environmental samples were analysed following standard methods. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed using SPSS 20.0 and PAST 1.97. Results showed that surface water dissolved oxygen and chemical oxygen demand were significantly lower, while sediment total organic matter and nitrates were significantly higher at the test site compared to the reference site. A total of 389 macrobenthic invertebrates comprising eight species and two macrobenthic invertebrates comprising one species as well as 121 fishes comprising nine species and 70 fishes comprising nine (9) species were recorded at the reference and test sites respectively. About 46.3% of respondents alluded to improper waste disposal as the major cause of pollution at the test site among others, 66.7% responded that wastes were disposed of by burning among other disposal methods, and 66.6% agreed that the sawmilling activities contributed to reduction of aquatic animal population. We recommend urgent regulatory intervention to address the indiscriminate discharge of wastes and facilitate adequate environmental risk advocacy to sustain life below water (United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14).

TI The Effect and Potential Mechanism of Cement-Based Pellets for Fluoride
   Removal from Surface Water
SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB Fluoride contamination in water is a global health concern. While many studies have used simulated fluoride-containing solutions in labs, few have conducted defluorination experiment on natural fluoride-contaminated water. In this study, we prepare three defluorination pellets (P1, P2, P3) using cement, sludge, and rice husk powder with mass percentages of 75%: 20%: 5%, 70%: 20%: 10%, and 65%: 20%: 15%, respectively, and tested their defluorination efficiency in water samples taken from the South Jiaolai River in Shandong Province, China. An outdoor experiment was conducted in May and June in Jiaozhou, Shandong Province, which lasted for 24 days. For each treatment, 10 g/L of pellets were added to 50 L of natural water samples with 3 replicates. The initial fluoride concentration of the water samples was 1.90 mg/L, and the fluoride concentration and pH value were measured every 3 days. SEM, EDS, XRD, and FTIR were used for analyzing potential defluorination mechanisms. The results showed that 3 types of pellets were effective in fluoride removal. On the 24th day, the fluoride concentrations in the water samples treated with pellets were significantly lower than that of the control group. The fluoride concentration in water samples treated with P1, P2, and P3 decreased to 0.74, 0.75, and 0.99 mg/L, respectively. AlF3 and MgF2 could be found in the composition of the pellets after the treatment of water samples, and hydroxylated metal oxides and CaCO3 both contributed to the defluorination process. The prepared pellets have potential for application in defluorination of fluoride-contaminated surface water.

SO MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
AB Purpose Total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and other physicochemical parameters of the Birim River, which serves for drinking and domestic purposes for rural mining communities, were analysed to assess the suitability of water quality for human consumption. Design/methodology/approach In total, 40 samples were collected from 20 sampling sites during the rainy season from July to September and the dry season from December to February in addition to two repeat samples and two blank samples. Samples were analysed for physiochemical parameters and the results were compared with World Health Organisation standards (WHO). Findings Data obtained for both rainy and dry seasons indicated TOC ranged from 1.1 to 7.3 mg/L and DOC 1-7.2 mg/L; pH, 5.6-8.63; temperature, 23.3-29.3 degrees C; turbidity, <1.00-869NTU; apparent colour, <2.5-600 mg/L Pt-Co; true colour <2.5-150 mg/L Pt-Co; alkalinity, 27.8-80.4 mg/L; total suspended solids, <1.00-998 mg/L; electrical conductivity, 82-184 mu S/cm; and bicarbonate, 33.9-98.1 mg/L. Particulate organic carbon (POC) was constituted between 1 and 10% of the TOC. Values for pH, turbidity, total suspended solids, and true colour indicated contamination of the river. p -value of Practical implications Water from the Birim River is unsuitable for human consumption and may constitute a serious health risk to the consumers. Originality/value The paper yields immense value to inhabitant of communities using surface water affected by mining activities, policy makers in sustainability. It warns of the unsuitability of water from the Birim River for human consumption due to the potential health risk to consumers.

TI Bioassessment of water quality of surface waters using diatom metrics
SO TURKISH JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB Bioassessment of surface waters is one of the most important approaches to predict the deterioration of ecosystems and achieve environmental sustainability according to the application of the European Water Framework Directive. The present review emphasizes the importance of the bioassessment of freshwater quality especially running waters based on diatom metrics. Nutrient enrichment and hydromorphological alternation driven by human activities are the main factors for the ecological compromise of freshwater ecosystems. Currently, the bioassessment of the ecological condition of inland water bodies is adopted worldwide. Bioassessment is complementary to physicochemical and hydromorphological data for evaluating the ecological conditions of rivers; however, measuring all the physical and chemical changes is expensive and impractical. Therefore, monitoring biota helps to determine the changes occurring in ecosystems. Thus, diatoms are used as bioindicators to assess environmental conditions of the ecosystems, but their use requires great taxonomic knowledge, otherwise, the results will be biased. Many diatom indices have been developed based on the trophic weight and indicator values of diatoms in different ecoregions in the last decades. This review highlights the importance and advantages of using diatom metrics in the bioassessment of the ecological status of surface waters in the different ecoregions, especially running water. To analyze the complex response of diatom communities to environmental gradients and assess the quality of the ecosystem, multivariate statistical approaches are needed.
   The challenge here is how to define criteria for classes of water bodies in a biologically meaningful way. For this reason, biological condition gradient is suggested as an appropriate and effective approach to develop trophic criteria based on the relationships between nutrient concentrations and biological indicators of ecological conditions.

TI Global Occurrence and Emission of Rotaviruses to Surface Waters
SO PATHOGENS
AB Group A rotaviruses (RV) are the major cause of acute gastroenteritis in infants and young children globally. Waterborne transmission of RV and the presence of RV in water sources are of major public health importance. In this paper, we present the Global Waterborne Pathogen model for RV (GloWPa-Rota model) to estimate the global distribution of RV emissions to surface water. To our knowledge, this is the first model to do so. We review the literature to estimate three RV specific variables for the model: incidence, excretion rate and removal during wastewater treatment. We estimate total global RV emissions to be 2 x 10(18) viral particles/grid/year, of which 87% is produced by the urban population. Hotspot regions with high RV emissions are urban areas in densely populated parts of the world, such as Bangladesh and Nigeria, while low emissions are found in rural areas in North Russia and the Australian desert. Even for industrialized regions with high population density and without tertiary treatment, such as the UK, substantial emissions are estimated. Modeling exercises like the one presented in this paper provide unique opportunities to further study these emissions to surface water, their sources and scenarios for improved management.

TI Septic systems contribute to nutrient pollution and harmful algal blooms
   in the St. Lucie Estuary, Southeast Florida, USA
SO HARMFUL ALGAE
AB Nutrient enrichment is a significant global-scale driver of change in coastal waters, contributing to an array of problems in coastal ecosystems. The St. Lucie Estuary (SLE) in southeast Florida has received national attention as a result of its poor water quality (elevated nutrient concentrations and fecal bacteria counts), recurring toxic Microcystis aeruginosa blooms, and its proximity to the northern boundary of tropical coral species in the United States. The SLE has an artificially large watershed comprised of a network of drainage canals, one of which (C-44) is used to lower the water level in Lake Okeechobee. Public attention has primarily been directed at nutrient inputs originating from the lake, but recent concern over the importance of local watershed impacts prompted a one-year watershed study designed to investigate the interactions between on-site sewage treatment and disposal systems (OSTDS or septic systems), groundwaters, and surface waters in the SLE and nearshore reefs. Results provided multiple lines of evidence of OSTDS contamination of the SLE and its watershed: 1) dissolved nutrients in groundwaters and surface waters were most concentrated adjacent to two older (pre-1978) residential communities and the primary canals, and 2) sucralose was present in groundwater at residential sites (up to 32.0 mu g/L) and adjacent surface waters (up to 5.5 mu g/L), and 3) delta N-15 values in surface water (+7.5 parts per thousand), macroalgae (+4.4 parts per thousand) and phytoplankton (+5.0 parts per thousand) were within the published range (>+3 parts per thousand) for sewage N and similar to values in OSTDS-contaminated groundwaters. Measured 815N values in M. aeruginosa became increasingly enriched during transport from the C-44 canal (similar to 5.8 parts per thousand) into the mid estuary (similar to 8.0 parts per thousand), indicating uptake and growth on sewage N sources within the urbanized estuary. Consequently, there is a need to reduce N and P loading, as well as fecal loading, from the SLE watershed via septic-to-sewer conversion projects and to minimize the frequency and intensity of the releases from Lake Okeechobee to the SLE via additional water storage north of the lake. These enhancements would improve water quality in both the SLE and Lake Okeechobee, reduce the occurrence of toxic harmful algal blooms in the linked systems, and improve overall ecosystem health in the SLE and downstream reefs.

TI Antibiotic Residue in the Aquatic Environment: Status in Africa
SO OPEN CHEMISTRY
AB Information on the presence of antibiotics is sparse for all types of water in Africa, including groundwater, surface water, effluent of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and municipal potable water. With the relatively high sales of different antibiotics to treat infectious diseases in the human population of Africa, the residual of the antibiotics is bound to be released through excretion via urine or fecal matter in parallel to the high sales. This article reviews the published analysis on the occurrence of antibiotics in the environment particularly in the aquatic environment in some countries in Africa. In general, sulfamethoxazole was the most commonly detected in Africa surface water (with eight reports from four countries) at a concentration range of 0.00027 - 39 mu gL(-1). Wastewater analysis is believed to give an early warning for preventing epidemics. Thus, we discuss the associated level of antibiotic resistance to some prevalent diseases in Africa whose aetiological agents can develop antibiotic resistance due to exposure to antibiotic residue in water. This is important because of rising population of immuno-deficient African residents ravaged by HIV/AIDS, poor nutrition and less efficient sanitation systems.

TI Monitoring of Organic Micropollutants in Effluents as Crucial Tool in
   Sustainable Development
SO PROBLEMY EKOROZWOJU
AB Water resources are crucial issues in sustainable development. From an economic perspective lack of clean water leads to long-lasting effects on human capital and growth. The key problem is to what extent can we give up on the economic growth to preserve the natural resources for future generations. Progress in monitoring will be critical in ensure to achieving sustainable development goals. However monitoring of the status quo is not the only strategy. The better one is monitoring of pollutants discharging in order to prevent or at least to limit their amounts. At present, the afore mentioned monitoring is not carried out with respect to municipal effluents despite the fact that these contaminants are found in the treated wastewater and should be monitored to avoid pollution of surface waters. The types of micropollutants that should be monitored have to be chosen individually for each wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) depending to local conditions that allows to fullfill the tasks in sustainable development. Recent changes in Polish legislations relying on which organic micropollutants are considered when classification of surface and underground water is made, are the proper directions.

TI Occurrence of the fungus mycotoxin, ustiloxin A, in surface waters of
   paddy fields in Enshi, Hubei, China, and toxicity in Tetrahymena
   thermophila
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB There has been an increasing incidence rate of rice false smut in global rice cultivation areas. However, there is a dearth of studies on the environmental concentrations and hazards of ustiloxin A (UA), which is the major mycotoxin produced by a pathogenic fungus of the rice false smut. Here, the concentrations of UA in the surface waters of two paddy fields located in Enshi city, Hubei province, China, were measured, and its toxicity in T. Thermophila was evaluated. This is the first study to detect UA in the surface waters of the two paddy fields, and the measured mean concentrations were 2.82 and 0.26 mu g/L, respectively. Exposure to 2.19, 19.01 or 187.13 mu g/L UA for 5 days significantly reduced the theoretical population and cell size of T. thermophila. Furthermore, treatment with 187.13 mu g/L UA changed the percentages of T. thermophila cells in different cell-cycle stages, and with an increased malformation rate compared with the control, suggesting the disruption of the cell cycle. The expressions of 30 genes involved in the enriched proteasome pathway, 7 cyclin genes (cyc9, cyc10, cyc16, cyc22, cyc23, cyc26, cyc33) and 2 histone genes (mlh1 and hho1) were significantly down-regulated, which might be the modes of action responsible for the disruption of cell cycling due to UA exposure.

SP Univ Florida, St Johns River Water Management Dist, S FL Water Management Dist
AB Several surveys of surface water quality in the 1980s and 1990s identified freshwater eutrophication as one of the main causes of concern in waters with impaired quality. As point source inputs of P have been greatly reduced in the last 20 years with detergent reformulations and improved wastewater treatment, agricultural runoff is now the major source of P in many eutrophic waters. Not only has the relative contribution of agricultural runoff to surface water inputs of P increased, but the potential for P loss in runoff has also increased in many areas of intensive crop and livestock production, where there has been a general increase in soil P. This has raised several issues of agricultural P management: consideration of regional P imbalances between system inputs and outputs, establishment of environmental threshold soil P levels, and targeting critical areas of P export from watersheds. With the specialization of farming since World War II, system components have consolidated in spatially distinct regions. For example most feed used in confined livestock operations in eastern States was imported from the Corn Belt. For several developed countries, only 30% of fertilizer and feed was output in plant and livestock produce, resulting in an average 22 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) surplus. Thus, P flows have changed from localized recycling to a one-way movement of P from areas of feed production to accumulate as manures in areas of livestock production. This often results in a buildup of soil P above levels required for crops, prompting concern of unacceptable P losses in areas vulnerable to runoff and erosion.

TI Mapping thermokarst lakes and ponds across permafrost landscapes in the
   Headwater Area of Yellow River on northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB The large variety of the semi-automated methods in mapping the surface water bodies and the frequent omission of ponds (< 10,000 m(2)) from permafrost regions inventories motivates this work. Based on the correlation matrix, several widely used classification methods for mapping the surface water bodies were assessed. Water bodies inventory was generated at a local and landscape scale in the Headwater Area of the Yellow River (HAYR) on a Sentinel-2 satellite image from 23 November 2015. The assessed methods are: spectral water indices, supervised and unsupervised classifiers (k-means, Density Slicing, Maximum Likelihood Classification - MLC), and machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and Support Vector Machines). The MLC method applied on visible and near-infrared (NIR) bands represents the best ratio regarding the accuracy (96%), Kappa coefficient (0.87), and water surface (14.87 km(2)). However, misclassifications are still present, which requires manual editing. Based on the MLC approach, 651 more water bodies were identified than previous inventories. Ponds are account for up to 93% of the 966 of individual water bodies and contribute to 42% of the total water surface, in the context that were omitted before. This analysis emphasize the importance of method settings for the classifier performance, as well as the ponds abundance and substantial contribution to the total water surface. This inventory will improve the general circulation models and provides baseline information for sustainable management of water resources in the HAYR, one of the core Asian Water Towers.

TI Using stable isotopes (& delta;H-2 and & delta;O-18) and hydrochemistry
   to understand the genesis and hydrochemical processes of groundwater in
   Chongming Island, Yangtze Estuary
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Groundwater is an indispensable freshwater resource and its quality is significant in supporting sustainable social and economic development, particularly in estuarine islands where aquifers are complicated. In this study, a total of 19 groundwater and 4 surface water samples were collected in September 2022 to identify the origin and hydrogeochemical evolution processes of groundwater using stable isotopes and hydrochemistry in Chongming Island, which is the largest estuarine alluvial island in the world. The stable isotopic composition indicated that shallow groundwater and surface water are all derived from precipitation recharge under a humid climate, and the evaporative effect incurs the enrichment of isotopic compositions. The shallow groundwater and surface water were primarily of Ca-HCO3 type. Gibbs diagram, ionic correlation analysis, ionic ratios analysis, and mineral saturation indices suggested that water-rock interactions like carbonate and silicate weathering play a vital role in groundwater chemistry, but cation exchange reactions are weak. Revelle index (RI) result indicated that 10.5% of shallow groundwater samples were found to suffer seawater intrusion. The NO3- concentrations were between l2.0 and 180.8 mg/L with 31.6% of groundwater samples exceeding the World health organization (WHO) standards (50 mg/L). Agricultural activities and industrial activities were found to be mainly responsible for groundwater pollution in shallow groundwater. The findings of this study provide a scientific basis for better managing groundwater resources on coastal estuarine islands.

TI Total concentrations and sources of heavy metal pollution in global
   river and lake water bodies from 1972 to 2017
SO GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB This study collected past sampling data on total concentrations of 12 heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Cr, Hg, Zn, Cu, Ni, Al, Fe, Mn, As, and Co) in surface water bodies, i.e., 168 rivers and 71 lakes, from 1972 to 2017. The intent was to investigate the levels and sources of heavy metal pollution across five decades and five continents. Mean heavy metal concentrations in global river and lake water, and the number of heavy metals with concentrations greater than the published threshold limits as per the standards of both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) were generally lower in the 1970s and 1980s than in the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. Over time, heavy metal pollution in surface water has changed from single metal pollution to mixed metal pollution. Heavy metal concentrations in water, and the number of heavy metals with concentrations above the threshold limits for both WHO and USEPA standards were lower in the developed countries of Europe and North America, and higher in the developing countries of Africa, Asia, and South America. Over time, the main sources of metal pollution have changed from mining and manufacturing to rock weathering and waste discharge. The main metal sources differed across the five continents, with fertilizer and pesticide use, along with rock weathering, being dominant in Africa. Mining and manufacturing, along with rock weathering, were dominant in Asia and Europe. Mining and manufacturing, along with fertilizer and pesticide use, were dominant sources in North America, while four sources (mining and manufacturing, fertilizer and pesticide use, rock weathering, and waste discharge) were responsible for the majority of heavy metal pollution in the river and lake water bodies of South America. Additionally, implementing rigorous standards on metal emissions and recycling metals from wastewater are effective for controlling heavy metal source pollution. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI Photothermally-activated peroxymonosulfate (PMS) pretreatment for
   fouling alleviation of membrane distillation of surface water:
   Performance and mechanism
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Membrane distillation (MD) has demonstrated its efficacy for seawater desalination, which prompted researchers to investigate its performance for the treatment of surface water containing natural organic matter (NOM). However, membrane fouling remains a significant technological constraint in the acceptability and imple-mentation of MD modules. Herein, for the first time, a photothermally-activated PMS pre-treatment process is coupled to a direct contact (DC)-MD module for effective membrane fouling control. Photothermally-activated PMS (2 mM) pre-treatment achieved 69 % of UV254 removal and 30.9 % of dissolved organic carbon removal and allowed stable operation of the DCMD without any reduction in water permeance vs 50 % reduction obtained without the pretreatment step. The analysis of NOM fractions after pre-treatment using Parallel Factor Analysis and molecular weight distribution indicated changes in NOM composition, which facilitated membrane fouling control. The photothermally-activated PMS pre-treatment seems to alleviate membrane fouling by limiting the foulant-membrane interaction, which was observed to result in the formation of the fouling layer containing aromatic proteins, microbial byproducts-like substances, and inorganic (e.g., calcium) foulants. Finally, char-acterization of the used MD membranes revealed that the MD membrane properties could be kept unchanged by the photothermally-activated PMS pre-treatment step, thereby making the integrated DCMD system sustainable and attractive for widespread applications.

TI Emerging organic contaminants in the River Ganga and key tributaries in
   the middle Gangetic Plain, India: Characterization, distribution &
   controls
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB The presence and distribution of emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) in freshwater environments is a key issue in India and globally, particularly due to ecotoxicological and potential antimicrobial resistance concerns. Here we have investigated the composition and spatial distribution of EOCs in surface water along a similar to 500 km segment of the iconic River Ganges (Ganga) and key tributaries in the middle Gangetic Plain of Northern India. Using a broad screening approach, in 11 surface water samples, we identified 51 EOCs, comprising of phar-maceuticals, agrochemicals, lifestyle and industrial chemicals. Whilst the majority of EOCs detected were a mixture of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, lifestyle chemicals (and particularly sucralose) occurred at the highest concentrations. Ten of the EOCs detected are priority compounds (e.g. sulfamethoxazole, diuron, atra-zine, chlorpyrifos, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorobutane sulfonate, thiamethoxam, imidacloprid, clothianidin and diclofenac). In almost 50% of water samples, sulfamethoxazole concentrations exceeded pre-dicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) for ecological toxicity. A significant downstream reduction in EOCs was observed along the River Ganga between Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh) and Begusarai (Bihar), likely reflecting dilution effects associated with three major tributaries, all with considerably lower EOC concentrations than the main Ganga channel. Sorption and/or redox controls were observed for some compounds (e.g. clopidol), as well as a relatively high degree of mixing of EOCs within the river. We discuss the environmental relevance of the persistence of several parent compounds (notably atrazine, carbamazepine, metribuzin and fipronil) and asso-ciated transformation products. Associations between EOCs and other hydrochemical parameters including excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence indicated positive, significant, and compound-specific correla-tions between EOCs and tryptophan-, fulvic-and humic-like fluorescence. This study expands the baseline characterization of EOCs in Indian surface water and contributes to an improved understanding of the potential sources and controls on EOC distribution in the River Ganga and other large river systems.

TI Environmental fate of pharmaceutical compounds and
   antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in hospital effluents, and
   contributions to pollutant loads in the surface waters in Japan
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Environmental fate of 58 pharmaceutical compounds (PhCs) grouped into 11 therapeutic classes in the three different waters, hospital effluent, sewage treatment plant (STP) and river water, was estimated by combination of their quantitative concentration analysis and evaluation of their extent of contribution as loading sources. At the same time, distribution of six classes of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (AMRB) in the same water samples was estimated by screening of individual PhC-resistant microbes grown on each specific chromogenic medium. The results indicate that 48 PhCs were detected ranged from 1 ng/L (losartan carboxylic acid) to 228 mu g/L (acetaminophen sulfate) in hospital effluent, and contribution of the pollution load derived from hospital effluent to STP influent was estimated as 0.1% to 15%. On the other hand, contribution of STP effluent to river water was high, 32% to 60% for antibacterials, antipertensives and X-ray contrast media. In the cases for AMRB, detected numbers of colonies of AMRB in hospital effluent ranged from 29 CFU/mL to 1805 CFU/mL, and the estimated contribution of the AMRB pollution load derived from hospital effluent to STP influent was as low as 0.1% (levofloxacin and olmesartan) to 5.1% (N-clesmethyl tamoxifen). Although the contribution of STPs as loading sources of PhCs and AMRB in surface waters was large, ozonation as an advanced water treatment system effectively removed a wide range of both PhCs and AMRB in water samples. These results suggest the importance of reducing environmental pollutant loads (not only at STPs but also at medical facilities) before being discharged into the surface waters, to both conserve water and keep the water environment safe. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show the distribution and contribution of AMRB from hospital effluent to the surface waters. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Among others, water resources are affected in many ways precisely with reference to the potable water availability. Achieving sustainable water resource is a challenge in the present scenario. This can be made possible through adopting indigenous knowledge and native technologies, as they are available immediately at low cost and are biodegradable. One such approach has been adopted in this study where natural coagulants are used to treat surface waters for removing pollutant parameters and producing potable water. Though ample studies have been carried out for the removal of natural organic matter and dissolved organic carbon using natural coagulants, adequate literature is not available with reference to the DOC induced by these coagulants. Hence, this parameter is of focal point in this work. This study has been taken up in the above lines using natural coagulants sago and chitin for removing turbidity of surface water making it fit for consumption. The present studies were carried out by using a conventional jar test apparatus. The results showed that the turbidity removal was 50%-84% in the supernatant and 77%-85% in the filtrate. Removal of other physicochemical parameters was also observed to be more than 50% using the above coagulants. Hence, it can be concluded that using natural coagulants used in this study will definitely provide safe drinking water along with aiding in adaptability in changing climatic conditions.

TI SuDS for managing surface water in Diepsloot informal settlement,
   Johannesburg, South Africa
SO WATER SA
AB Sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) imitate natural water management processes in catchments that have been degraded due to urbanisation. The aim is to reduce the quantity of stormwater runoff and improve water quality. Management of rainwater in the informal settlement of Diepsloot in Johannesburg is compounded by domestic wastewater discharged into the informal lanes. These lanes fall outside the mandate of the City of Johannesburg's stormwater management system; hence residents need to rely on their own initiatives to address surface-water problems. This preliminary study investigated the introduction of SuDS to enhance existing surface-water interventions, as a low-cost flexible approach. Using action research methods, small-scale interventions were designed, constructed and refined by residents and researchers at two sites close to the Jukskei River. While the primary intention of the research was to reduce standing water in the public areas, water quality testing indicates that the SuDS reduced some pollutants. Nitrate and phosphate concentrations were slightly lowered through the introduction of permeable channels and soakaways, while these interventions had a moderate effect on chemical oxygen demand. The involvement of residents at the two sites was markedly different, reflecting divergent priorities and social dynamics. Spontaneous continuation of the SuDS system at one of the sites indicates successful knowledge and skills exchange. This study was of limited duration with only two sets of water quality tests; therefore, longer term monitoring is strongly advised to be able to give more robust assessment of this type of intervention.

TI Global trends in the fluorescence characteristics and distribution of
   marine dissolved organic matter
SO MARINE CHEMISTRY
AB A fraction of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is able to fluoresce. This ability has been used in the present study to investigate the characteristics and distribution of different DOM fractions. A unique global dataset revealed seven different fluorescent fractions of DOM: two humic-like, four amino acid-like and one chemically uncharacterized. The spectral characteristics of the amino acid-like fractions resemble those of pure tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine. The fluorescence intensities of these amino acid-like fractions are highest in the surface waters, rapidly decreasing with depth and at a constant low level in the bathypelagic layer. Such profiles indicate that amino acid-like DOM is linked to surface water production. From calibration curves we estimated the mean surface water concentrations of tryptophan and tyrosine to be 12.5 and similar to 15.9 nmol L-1, respectively, while mean deep water concentrations are 5.1 and similar to 6.5 nmol L-1. The fluorescence intensities of the humic-like DOM fractions were low in the surface layer, rapidly increasing in the mesopelagic layer and at constant high level in the bathypelagic layer. The low fluorescence intensities observed in the surface layer indicate the quantitative importance of photochemical degradation as a sink of the humic-like compounds. In the dark ocean (below 200 m), significant linear relationships between humic-like DOM fluorescence and microbial activity (apparent oxygen utilization. NO3- and PO43-) were found. These observations imply a link to dark ocean microbial remineralization and indicate that the major source of humic-like compounds is microbial turnover of organic matter. The results of the present study show that the distribution of the humic-like DOM fractions is a balance between supply from continental run off, net microbial production and photochemical removal in surface waters.

TI Occurrence and Treatment of Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Present in
   Surface Water
SO MEMBRANES
AB According to the World Health Organization, antibiotic resistance is one of the main threats to global health. The excessive use of several antibiotics has led to the widespread distribution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes in various environment matrices, including surface water. In this study, total coliforms, Escherichia coli and enterococci, as well as total coliforms and Escherichia coli resistant to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ampicillin, streptomycin, and imipenem, were monitored in several surface water sampling events. A hybrid reactor was used to test the efficiency of membrane filtration, direct photolysis (using UV-C light emitting diodes that emit light at 265 nm and UV-C low pressure mercury lamps that emit light at 254 nm), and the combination of both processes to ensure the retention and inactivation of total coliforms and Escherichia coli as well as antibiotic-resistant bacteria (total coliforms and Escherichia coli) present in river water at occurrence levels. The membranes used (unmodified silicon carbide membranes and the same membrane modified with a photocatalytic layer) effectively retained the target bacteria. Direct photolysis using low-pressure mercury lamps and light-emitting diode panels (emitting at 265 nm) achieved extremely high levels of inactivation of the target bacteria. The combined treatment (unmodified and modified photocatalytic surfaces in combination with UV-C and UV-A light sources) successfully retained the bacteria and treated the feed after 1 h of treatment. The hybrid treatment proposed is a promising approach to use as point-of-use treatment by isolated populations or when conventional systems and electricity fail due to natural disasters or war. Furthermore, the effective treatment obtained when the combined system was used with UV-A light sources indicates that the process may be a promising approach to guarantee water disinfection using natural sunlight.

TI Environmental risk assessment for sustainable pesticide use in coffee
   production
SO JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY
AB The extensive use of pesticides in agricultural practices has been associated with human health problems and environmental contamination worldwide. Brazil is the largest consumer of pesticides in the world and Espirito Santo State stands out as the second Brazilian producer of coffee. However, there is no information about environmental impact of coffee producing at Itapemirim River Basin (IRB) region, Espirito Santo State, Brazil; hence a simple and quick method using open access softwares (AGROSCRE and ARAqua Web) to estimate surface entrainment and pesticide leaching potential was carried out. AGROSCRE evaluates the contamination risk of superficial and groundwater by Active Ingredients (AIs), using GOSS Method, GUS index and US EPA criteria, while ARAqua Web estimates AI concentrations in water resources, indicating their suitability based on water quality requirements for different uses. Regarding pesticides used in coffee plantations, there is 44.7% chance of surface water and 23.7% chance of groundwater contamination. Results showed that ametryne, cyproconazole, diuron, epoxiconazole, flutriafol, triadimenol and triazophos pose contamination risk to both surface water and groundwater in the IRB region. Of these, 10.5% of the total AIs are triazoles and fall under environmental classes II and III (Product Very/Dangerous to the Environment). The AIs ametryne, thiamethoxam, iprodione, flutriafol, triazophos, endosulfan, triadimenol, cyproconazole, diuron, pendimethalin, chlorpyrifos, copper II hydroxide, etion, epoxiconazole and paraquat dichloride, were found to be potentially toxic, presenting environmental concentrations ranging from 123.40 mu g L-1 to 0.14 mu g L-1, which are higher than the safety standard for potable water (0.1 mu g L-1). With respect to these AIs, chlorpyrifos, ethion and triazophos showed concentrations higher than EC50 values for aquatic invertebrates and ametryne and diuron for algae. Thus, local residents and environment may be at high risk of pesticide exposure, when these AIs are used in coffee plantations next to surface water or groundwater.

TI Exploring associations between water, sanitation, and anemia through 47
   nationally representative demographic and health surveys
SO ANNALS OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES
AB Globally, no countries are on track to achieve the adopted global nutrition targets set for anemia in 2025. Given the linkages between water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and nutrition, this secondary data analysis explores potential associations with anemia. Forty-seven demographic and health surveys were used to explore the association between unimproved water and sanitation and anemia in women and children with adjusted odds ratios (ORs) calculated by country and cumulatively. In over 60% of countries, children with off-premises water access had significantly increased odds of anemia. In over a quarter of countries, children exposed to surface water had higher odds of anemia. In Burundi, children were 1.65 times more likely to be anemic when reported to be living in households using surface water. However, in India, a protective effect was noted (adjusted OR: 0.70, P < 0.001) for surface water. In 60% and 65% of countries, women and children exposed to an open sanitation facility had higher odds of being anemic, respectively. There is evidence of an association between selected water and sanitation indicators and anemia. Promoting policies, practices and research that strengthen access to improved WASH should be considered for reducing anemia prevalence alongside standard nutrition interventions.

TI Microplastic pollution in Chinese urban rivers: The influence of urban
   factors
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Microplastics are being widely discussed as an emerging global environmental contaminant. Microplastic pollution usually originates from land-based sources, which are then mainly transported through hydrological and atmospheric pathways and accumulated in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. Urban environments represent a condensed area of human activities (including the production and use of plastic materials), and urban rivers may therefore be a key transporter of microplastic pollution. Understanding microplastic abundances in urban rivers is potentially important in finding effective means of reducing fluvial microplastic discharge. This study quantified microplastic abundances in surface waters along the Fenghua River, Ningbo, a coastal megacity in East China. Microplastic pollution was distributed unevenly along the river, with concentrations ranging from 300 n/m(3) to 4000 n/m(3) (0.3 - 4.0 n/L). Average concenterations were 1620.16 +/- 878.22 n/m(3) (1.62 +/- 0.88 n/L) in summer (43 sampling points) and 1696.08 +/- 983.52 n/m(3) (1.70 +/- 0.98 n/L) in winter (17 sampling points). The most common microplastic shapes, sizes, colors and types of polymers were fiber, <0.5mm, transparent and polypropylene, respectively. Using multidimensional scaling analysis, microplastic distribution patterns were related to seasonal factors and levels of urbanization. No clear relationships were found, with implications for site selection when studying microplastics and the challenges of attributing sources to microplastic pollution in urban rivers.

TI Pathogen infection risk to recreational water users, associated with
   surface waters impacted by de facto and indirect potable reuse
   activities
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Water deficit, exacerbated by global population increases and climate change, necessitates the investigation of alternative non-traditional water sources to augment existing supplies. Indirect potable reuse (IPR) represents a promising alternative water source in water-stressed regions. Of high concern is the presence of pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater, such as enteric viruses, protozoa and bacteria. Therefore, a greater understanding of the potential impact to human health is required. The aim of this research was to use a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) approach to calculate the probability of potential pathogen infection risk to the public in surface waters used for a range of recreational activities under scenarios: 1) existing de facto wastewater reuse conditions; 2) after augmentation with conventionally treated wastewater; and 3) after augmentation with reclaimed wastewater from proposed IPR schemes. Forty-four 31 l samples were collected from river sites and a coastal wastewater treatment works from July 2016-May 2017. Concentrations of faecal indicator organisms (enterococci, faecal coli forms, somatic coliphages and Bacteroides phages) determined using culture-based approaches and selected pathogens (adenovirus, Salmonella and Cryptosporidium) determined using molecular approaches (qPCR) were used to inform QMRA. The mean probability of infection from adenovirus under de facto conditions was high (>0.90) for all recreational activities, per single event. The risk of adenovirus and Cryptosporidium infection increased under augmentation scenario (2) (mean probability 0.95-1.00 and 0.01-0.06 per single event, respectively). Adenovirus and Cryptosporidium infection risk decreased under reclaimed water augmentation scenario (3) (mean probability <0.79, excluding swimming, which remained 1.00 and <0.01 per single event, respectively). Pathogen reduction after reclaimed water augmentation in surface waters impacted by de facto reuse, provides important evidence for alternative water supply option selection. As such, this evidence may inform water managers and the public of the potential benefits of IPR and improve acceptance of such practices in the future. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of Anthropogenic Disturbances and Climate Change on Riverine
   Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen Transport
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
AB Nitrogen (N) transport from land to rivers, estuaries, and coastal marine systems has been markedly altered by anthropogenic and climatic drivers over recent decades. In this study, a riverine N transport scheme considering anthropogenic N discharge and water regulation was incorporated into the Land Surface Model of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS-LSM). Seven groups of simulations using the developed model at the global scale for the period of 1981-2010 were conducted to investigate the effects of anthropogenic disturbances and climate change on riverine dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) transport. It was shown that fertilization and point source pollution have enhanced the DIN fluxes in rivers across the world, especially in western Europe and eastern China. The DIN exports were significantly reduced due to retention by reservoirs and the withdrawal of surface water and groundwater, with a retention efficiency of 50-70%. Climate variability and trends increased or decreased the riverine DIN fluxes depending on the specific hydroclimatic conditions. We further analyzed the contributions of climatic and anthropogenic changes to the riverine DIN changes in four major rivers. The riverine DIN exports in the Mississippi River Basin were affected primarily by fertilization, while the changes in DIN exports of the Danube were dominated by point source pollution and water regulation. The Yangtze River in China was seriously affected by both fertilization and point source pollution, and water regulation played a significant role in reducing DIN exports. Climate variability was the primary factor explaining the interannual variability of DIN exports.
   Plain Language Summary Nitrogen (N) transport from land to rivers, estuaries, and coastal marine systems has been markedly altered by anthropogenic and climatic drivers over recent decades.

TI Hydrochemical and environmental isotope analysis of groundwater and
   surface water in a dry mountain region in Northern Chile
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB This case study examines the geological imprint and land use practices on water quality in the arid Huasco Valley against the backdrop of ongoing water conflicts surrounding competing demands for agriculture and mining. The study is based on a detailed analysis of spatial and temporal variations of monthly surface and bi-monthly groundwater quality samples measured during the Chilean summer of 2015/16. Additional information on source regions and river-groundwater interactions were collected using stable water isotopes. Regarding the geological impact on water quality, high concentrations of Ca2+, SO4 (2-) and HCO3 (-) indicate a strong influence of magmatic rocks, which constitute this high mountain basin, on the hydrochemistry. Piper and Gibbs-diagrams revealed that all samples show a homogenous distribution dominated by rock-water interactions. Measured NO3 (-) concentrations in surface water are generally low. However, groundwater aquifers exhibit higher concentrations. Mn is the only heavy metal with elevated concentrations in surface water, which are possibly related to mining activities. The results illustrate that both surface and groundwater can be classified as suitable for irrigation. In addition, groundwater has been found to be suitable as drinking water. High similarities in isotopic signatures indicate a strong connection between surface and groundwater. Isotopic analyses suggest a strong influence of evaporation. This combined approach of hydrogeochemical and isotopic analysis proved to be a helpful tool in characterizing the catchment and can serve as a basis for future sustainable water management.

AB The quantity of available water resources have been recognized as limiting factors in development of most of the arid regions. Therefore, sustainable use of water resources is key problem for development of these areas. In the present paper, Hetao irrigation district, one of the largest irrigation districts in the Yellow River basin, is selected as the research area. The sustainable utilization coupled management model for water resources is established by dynamically coupling numerical simulated model for ground water with optimal allocation model. In the coupled model, the groundwater level is adopted as the constraint condition and the optimal conjunctive utilization quantity of surface water and groundwater is set as the objective function. Finally, the coupled model is applied to calculate the optimal water supply quantity of surface water and groundwater and optimal sustainable utilization scheme of water resources in 2020 and 2030 of Hetao irrigation district. The results indicate that the water imported from the Yellow River can be reduced to the national limited amount of 4.0 x 10(9) m(3)/a, with adjusting wellcanal irrigated area and industry structure appropriately as well as using the ground water reasonably. The research result can offer a valuable reference to efficiently use water resources and prevent the salinization for other similar regions.

   policies of microplastic pollution in riverine ecosystem: A review
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Microplastics (<5 mm) have become an environmental hazard to natural ecosystems and humanity due to their ubiquitous presence in the environment, and possess detrimental effects on aquatic organisms. Sampling, extrac-tion, and detection of microplastics from sediments, surface water, and biota are quite complex and challenging. Rigorous research on the abundance and distribution of microplastics in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is pri-marily attributed to instinctive anthropogenic actions like land-based activities. Although, the fate and transport of microplastics in the environment are uncertain. Therefore, this paper reviews current research progress on the occurrence and distribution of microplastic pollution in the riverine ecosystem. Detailed potential sources, sam-pling techniques, and experimental design have been discussed, along with the classification and detection of microplastics in the riverine sediment and surface water. Microplastic ingestion through riverine species is also discussed systematically which emphasizes the extraction of microplastics from different body parts of the organism. Different types of polymeric microplastic have been observed in rivers, for instance, PS, PE, PP, PA, PET, PVC, PDPE, LPDE, nylon, acrylic, etc. using spectroscopy. Fragments, foams, pellets, films, fibers and microbeads are common shapes of microplastic which are abundant in the riverine ecosystem. The ingestion and ecological concern of microplastics, along with adsorption mechanisms of toxic contaminants, such as heavy metals, organic pollutants, nutrients, antibiotics, etc. onto microplastics surface and their exposure to aquatic organisms have also been discussed. Microplastic pollution in riverine ecosystems is under global change stress due to ecotoxicological and geochemical consequences. Further, detailed policies intervention for plastics and microplastics mitigation have been focused which delineate for application of science and policy together with scientific evidence. Lastly, scientific knowledge gaps and future research prospective on microplastic pollution have been given, along with suggestions and policy recommendations.

TI A Potential Approach of Reporting Risk to Baseflow from Increased
   Groundwater Extraction in the Murray-Darling Basin, South-Eastern
   Australia
SO WATER
AB An approach of reporting long-term trends in groundwater extraction and baseflow impacts in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) in south-eastern Australia was developed and tested. The principal aim of the framework was to provide early warning of any potential adverse impacts from groundwater extraction on environmental releases of surface water for baseflow, support adaptive management of these impacts, and highlight those areas which may benefit from conjunctive water management. The analysis showed that there is no current decadal trend in the annual aggregate groundwater extraction volumes or stream impact across the non-Victorian MDB, with much of the interannual variability being related to rainfall. Despite this, increasing volumes of environmental releases of water for baseflows in some river valleys are being required to replace the stream depletion caused by historical patterns of groundwater extraction established before 2003. Two valleys were identified for which there may be insufficient surface water storage to release water to substitute stream losses to groundwater and still support ecosystems during dry periods. The increasing trend in extraction since 2003 in one of the units has significantly increased the risk in that valley. The reporting framework was shown to be effective for alluvial groundwater systems connected to regulated rivers.

AB Quality of drinking water has become more important in India as a result of the numerous human activities that are contaminating it and the need to assure its continued safe use. Determining the quality of the treated water is crucial for this. In this study, the Mahanadi River in Odisha was taken into account, which has drawn significant attention due to rising urban pollution loads that have adversely damaged its ecosystem processes and water quality. 20 physicochemical parameters from 19 surface water samples collected during an 18-year period (2000-2018) were reviewed. Huge and diverse surface water quality databases were analyzed using multivariate statistical techniques such as correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA). Using Karl Pearson's correlation matrix, correlation analysis reveals a strong positive correlation of TDS, EC strongly correlated with B, Cl-, TH, and SO42- correlate with B and TH, Cl- with SO42- and Cl-, SO42- with TH. 19 sampling sites are grouped into three main clusters by CA using dendrogram plots to identify surface water characteristics. Following the use of PCA/FA, five primary components with a combined variance of 93.899 percent were identified as the root causes of the decline in water quality. TSS, EC, TDS, B, TH, Cl- and SO42- have all been correlated with (loading greater than 0.9) in the PC1, which accounted for 43.133 % of the total variance. COD, NH3N, Free NH3, SAR; pH, F were all linked to the PC2, which accounted for 23.055 % of total variation, whereas the 3rd, 4th, and 5th PCs, while accounting for 12.866 %, 8.603 %, and 6.241 % of total variation, respectively. It confirms high pollution load in water samples. It is advised to regularly monitor the parameters in order to protect surface water supplies to maintain water quality for drinking.

AB This work focused on alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEOs) and bisphenol A (BPA) in surface water at the scale of the upper part of the Seine basin Although this basin is vulnerable, since it undergoes a combination of strong human pressures (Paris conurbation) with very limited dilution via the Seine River, no comprehensive data was available for these compounds In this context, the evolution of the pollutant concentrations and loads was assessed during two sampling campaigns (April and July 2009) along a 300 km-transect Hence, 18 stations (10 sites on the Seine River, four tributaries and four wastewater treatment plants WWTPs) were considered Additional campaigns were also conducted over 2009 on four sites on the Seine River The BPA concentrations range from 7 2 to 127 ng l(1) in surface water, while higher concentrations of APEOs (324 +/- 153 ng l(1)) were observed Based on our first results, no spatial variability of concentrations between up- and downstream sites, or any seasonal variability, were highlighted During the longitudinal campaigns, an increase of the pollutant loads between up- and downstream sites was clearly noticed Contrary to BPA, for which a limited seasonal variation of loads was observed at the basin outlet (1,400 and 1,500 g d (1)), the APEO loads significantly vary (10,000 and 5,500 g d (1)) Mass balances between the inputs (tributaries + WWTPs) and the exported loads reveal that the BPA inputs are lower than the exported loads, suggesting that other inputs have to be considered along the transect studied For APEOs, the inputs appear higher than the exported loads, underscoring the in-stream removal of APEOs Globally, the results reveal that the removal of APEOs and the number of ethoxylate units are correlated the longer the ethoxylate chain, the higher the removal

TI Pharmaceutical compounds in drinking water
SO JOURNAL OF XENOBIOTICS
AB Pharmacetutical products and their wastes play a major role in the degradation of environment. These drugs have positive as well as negative consequences on different environmental components including biota in different ways. Many types of pharmaceutical substances have been detected with significant concentrations through various advanced instrumental techniques in surface water, subsurface water, ground water, domestic waste water, municipal waste water and industrial effluents. The central as well as state governments in India are providing supports by creating excise duty free zones to promote the pharmaceutical manufacturers for their production. As a result, pharmaceutical companies are producing different types of pharmaceutical products at large scale and also producing complex non-biodegradable toxic wastes by-products and releasing untreated or partially treated wastes in the environment in absence of strong regulations. These waste pollutants are contaminating all types of drinking water sources. The present paper focuses on water quality pollution by pharmaceutical pollutants, their occurrences, nature, metabolites and their fate in the environment.

TI Evaluation of the land surface water budget in NCEP/NCAR and NCEP/DOE
   reanalyses using an off-line hydrologic model
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
AB The ability of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis (NRA1) and the follow-up NCEP/Department of Energy (DOE) reanalysis (NRA2), to reproduce the hydrologic budgets over the Mississippi River basin is evaluated using a macroscale hydrology model. This diagnosis is aided by a relatively unconstrained global climate simulation using the NCEP global spectral model, and a more highly constrained regional climate simulation using the NCEP regional spectral model, both employing the same land surface parameterization (LSP) as the reanalyses. The hydrology model is the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model, which is forced by gridded observed precipitation and temperature. It reproduces observed streamflow, and by closure is constrained to balance other terms in the surface water and energy budgets. The VIC-simulated surface fluxes therefore provide a benchmark for evaluating the predictions from the reanalyses and the climate models. The comparisons, conducted for the 10-year period 1988-1997 , show the well-known overestimation of summer precipitation in the southeastern Mississippi River basin, a consistent overestimation of evapotranspiration, and an underprediction of snow in NRA1. These biases are generally lower in NRA2, though a large overprediction of snow water equivalent exists. NRA1 is subject to errors in the surface water budget due to nudging of modeled soil moisture to an assumed climatology. The nudging and precipitation bias alone do not explain the consistent overprediction of evapotranspiration throughout the basin. Another source of error is the gravitational drainage term in the NCEP LSP, which produces the majority of the model's reported runoff. This may contribute to an overprediction of persistence of surface water anomalies in much of the basin. Residual evapotranspiration inferred from an atmospheric balance of NRA1, which is more directly related to observed atmospheric variables, matches the VIC prediction much more closely than the coupled models. However, the persistence of the residual evapotranspiration is much less than is predicted by the hydrological model or the climate models.

TI Aquatic and terrestrial cyanobacteria produce methane
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB Evidence is accumulating to challenge the paradigm that biogenic methanogenesis, considered a strictly anaerobic process, is exclusive to archaea. We demonstrate that cyanobacteria living in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments produce methane at substantial rates under light, dark, oxic, and anoxic conditions, linking methane production with light-driven primary productivity in a globally relevant and ancient group of photoautotrophs. Methane production, attributed to cyanobacteria using stable isotope labeling techniques, was enhanced during oxygenic photosynthesis. We suggest that the formation of methane by cyanobacteria contributes to methane accumulation in oxygen-saturated marine and limnic surface waters. In these environments, frequent cyanobacterial blooms are predicted to further increase because of global warming potentially having a direct positive feedback on climate change. We conclude that this newly identified source contributes to the current natural methane budget and most likely has been producing methane since cyanobacteria first evolved on Earth.

TI ASSESSMENT OF WATER QUALITY; A CASE STUDY OF BUYUK MENDERES RIVER BASIN
SO FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
AB The quality of natural waters can be seriously affected by both point and not-point pollution sources such as industrial discharges, agricultural activities, water withdrawal, drought, and floods.Buyuk Menderes River Basin in Turkey is subjected to these factors. It is required to evaluate its water quality for sustainable surface water management. The European Commission Water Framework Directive (WFD) was constructed to monitor water quality for rivers, lakes and transitional and coastal waters utilizing networks. Countries evaluated the Water Framework Directive and principles of WFD have been adapted to the legislation of the country over the past eighteen years. Therefore, this study was conducted in Buyuk Menderes River Basin to determine its water quality classes according to the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs' Regulation (WAR) for Management of Surface Water. Seasonal samples were collected from 39 surveillance monitoring stations. The parameters monitored stated in the regulation were physical ones as temperature, pH, COD and BOD, nutrient parameters, etc. Annual averages of the monitored physico-chemical pollution parameters were used to determine the water quality classes of stations and the whole river basin. The results indicated that the water quality of Buyuk Menderes River Basin was either class III or class IV. Besides, the water quality of Buyuk Menderes River Basin was presented based on Water Framework Directive. So, two regulations (WAR and WFD) were compared with each other according to water quality classification.

TI Surface water quality management using an integrated discharge permit
   and the reclaimed water market
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Water quality trading is a sustainable framework for surface water quality management. It uses discharge permits to reduce the total treatment costs. For example, the case of Gharesoo River in Iran shows that the nitrogen permit market between point and non-point sources is 37% more economical than the command and control framework. Nevertheless, the cost saving may be reduced to 6% by the end of the study period (2050). This depression may be due to the limited technical support for wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, an integrated market is recommended in which the discharge permits and the reclaimed water are traded simultaneously. In this framework, the allocation of secondary treated domestic wastewater for irrigation can provide capacity for other pollutants to discharge into the surface water. This innovative approach may decrease the total treatment costs by 63% at present, while 65%, may be achieved by the end of the study period. Furthermore, this market is able to determine the environmental penalty, trading permits, and reuse prices. For example, the maximum ratio of the average reuse price to the penalty cost is determined as 1 to 10. It is introduced as an incentive indicator for stakeholders to consider the integrated market. Consequently, the applicability and the efficiency of using this approach are verified long term.

TI Occurrence, Distribution, and Ecological Risk Assessment of Antibiotics
   in Different Environmental Media in Anqing, Anhui Province, China
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB The widespread usage of antibiotics in human and animal medication has brought global concerns over environmental contamination of antibiotic residues. In this study, 16 kinds of antibiotics in different environmental media of water, sediments, and soils in Anqing city, Anhui province were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A total of fourteen kinds of antibiotics were detected in surface water, with a total concentration up to 479 ng center dot L-1, while six kinds of antibiotics were detected in sediment and soil with concentrations ranging from 15.1 to 108 mu g center dot kg(-1). Ciprofloxacin (12.8-99.5 ng center dot L-1) and tetracycline (17.2-225 mu g center dot kg(-1)) antibiotics exhibited the highest concentration in water and soil, respectively. In spatial distribution, the total concentration of antibiotics in surface water from the highest to the lowest followed the order of urban area, mainstream of Wan River, suburbs, tributaries of Wan River, indicating that the level of antibiotic concentration in surface water is positively associated with the frequency of human activities. In addition, the antibiotic mass fraction in agriculture land and fishpond were found higher than that in other sampling sites. Moreover, the environmental risk assessment results showed that ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, ofloxacin, enrofloxacin and tetracycline might pose medium to high risks to algae and bacteria in aquatic ecosystem.

SWHP systems are energy-efficient systems that use energy stored in bodies of water to heat and cool buildings. Both the broad and local environmental impacts of SWHP systems compared to conventional residential space-conditioning systems are explored. Significant energy savings result from the use of SWHP systems versus conventional systems, resulting in a reduction of emissions such as CO2, SO2, NO2, and mercury (Hg) from local powerplants. The local environmental impacts include potential water temperature and level changes and the reduction of refrigerant required in SWHP systems over conventional systems. This decreases the risk of ozone depleting and global warming effects of the refrigerant due to leaks. The environmental and health risks from the use of the nontoxic antifreeze propylene glycol in SWHP systems are also investigated.

TI Quantifying the potential for reservoirs to secure future surface water
   yields in the world's largest river basins
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Surface water reservoirs provide us with reliable water supply, hydropower generation, flood control and recreation services. Yet reservoirs also cause flow fragmentation in rivers and lead to flooding of upstream areas, thereby displacing existing land-use activities and ecosystems. Anticipated population growth and development coupled with climate change in many regions of the globe suggests a critical need to assess the potential for future reservoir capacity to help balance rising water demands with long-term water availability. Here, we assess the potential of large-scale reservoirs to provide reliable surface water yields while also considering environmental flows within 235 of the world's largest river basins. Maps of existing cropland and habitat conservation zones are integrated with spatially-explicit population and urbanization projections from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways to identify regions unsuitable for increasing water supply by exploiting new reservoir storage. Results show that even when maximizing the global reservoir storage to its potential limit (similar to 4.3-4.8 times the current capacity), firm yields would only increase by about 50% over current levels. However, there exist large disparities across different basins. The majority of river basins in North America are found to gain relatively little firm yield by increasing storage capacity, whereas basins in Southeast Asia display greater potential for expansion as well as proportional gains in firm yield under multiple uncertainties. Parts of Europe, the United States and South America show relatively low reliability of maintaining current firm yields under future climate change, whereas most of Asia and higher latitude regions display comparatively high reliability. Findings from this study highlight the importance of incorporating different factors, including human development, land-use activities, and climate change, over a time span of multiple decades and across a range of different scenarios when quantifying available surface water yields and the potential for reservoir expansion.

TI Floating treatment wetland integrated with sediment microbial fuel cell
   for low-strength surface water treatment
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The combination of floating treatment wetland (FTW) and sediment microbial fuel cell (SMFC) has drawn increasing interest as an economical, effective, and environmentally sustainable method for energy recovery, remediation of contaminated sediments, and wastewater treatment. In this study, a novel FTW-SMFC system with vertical floating biocathodes was developed to evaluate the performance and mechanism of plants, substrates, and bio-electrochemical systems for treating low-strength surface water. Experiments were operated in batch mode and conducted in microcosms with the following six treatments: control system only containing water and sediment (CS), normal SMFC (SMFC), only plant system (PS), SMFC with plants (PSMFC), SMFC with substrates (S-SMFC), and SMFC with plants and substrates (S-PSMFC). The results show that introducing plants into SMFCs could increase the power density by 32.9-42.5%, proving that plants played an important role in enhancing bioelectricity production. The alkaline substrates reduced the cathode potential and made the cathode ineffi-cient. The presence of plants and substrates greatly improved the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus. The removal efficiency of total nitrogen and total phosphorus increased by 8.3-27.8% and 3.5-13.9% under elec-trochemical treatment. There existed competition between electrochemical and plant removal approaches for nitrogen in FTW-SMFC, and electrochemical removal was prior to plant removal. Phosphorus removal was mainly through plant uptake and substrate-mediated adsorption and precipitation. The electrochemical process promoted the removal of phosphorus by enhancing the conversion of non-reactive phosphorus (NRP) to reactive phosphorus, providing 5.0-6.9% additional NRP conversion. This study furthers our understanding of the contribution and interaction of each component in the FTW-SMFC system to pollutant removal and bioenergy generation, which will contribute to the performance enhancement of FTW and further facilitate the application of FTW-SMFC technology for in-situ remediations of the polluted surface water body.

TI Examining the potential for energy-positive bulk-water infrastructure to
   provide long-term urban water security: A systems approach
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Urban centres are increasingly requiring more water than existing groundwater and surface water sources can supply. Water authorities must consider energy intensive supply alternatives such as recycling and desalination, leading to a water-energy-climate conundrum. In this study, a systems perspective of the water-energy-climate nexus is applied to South-East Queensland (SEQ), Australia. Under a changing climate, SEQ is predicted to experience reduced reservoir inflows and increased evaporation rates, which will consequently lead to reduced water availability. To exacerbate this issue, anticipated high population growth in SEQ will increase water demand, putting even more stress on the traditional water supply sources. Clearly, there is a strong incentive to pursue solutions that increase water security without contributing to anthropogenic climate change. Using a system dynamics model, the water balance of the bulk water supply system is evaluated over a 100-year life cycle. The outputs of the model are used to investigate potential management and infrastructure options available to SEQ for adapting to increased water scarcity. The historical rainfall patterns of SEQ requires significant contingency to be built into surface water capacity in order to mitigate low rainfall years, and provide adequate water security. In contrast, reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plants do not require this excess capacity because they are rain-independent. However, RO has high energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions when operating and their potential long periods of redundancy due to periods of sufficient surface water supplies remain unresolved issues. The model demonstrates that dual purpose pressure retarded osmosis desalination plants offer a potential solution, by providing water security at a lower cost than surface water reservoir augmentation, while offsetting energy use through renewable energy generation when RO plants would otherwise be sitting idle. Potentially this technology represents a future sustainable solution to overcome water security concerns. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Global patterns for the spatial distribution of floating microfibers:
   Arctic Ocean as a potential accumulation zone
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Despite their representativeness, most studies to date have underestimated the amount of microfibers (MFs) in the marine environment. Therefore, further research is still necessary to identify key processes governing MF distribution. Here, the interaction among surface water temperature, salinity, currents and winds explained the patterns of MF accumulation. The estimated density of floating MFs is similar to 5900 +/- 6800 items m3 in the global ocean; and three patterns of accumulation were predicted by the proposed model: (i) intermediate densities in ocean gyres, Seas of Japan and of Okhotsk, Mediterranean and around the Antarctic Ocean; (ii) high densities in the Arctic Ocean; and (iii) point zones of highest densities inside the Arctic Seas. Coastal areas and upwelling systems have low accumulation potential. At the same time, zones of divergences between westerlies and trade winds, located above the tropical oceanic gyres, are predicted to accumulate MFs. In addition, it is likely that the warm branch of the thermohaline circulation has an important role in the transport of MFs towards the Arctic Ocean, emphasizing that surface water masses are important predictors. This study highlights that the Arctic Ocean is a dead end for floating MFs.

TI Typhoon-induced turbulence redistributed microplastics in coastal areas
   and reformed plastisphere community
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB The increasing microplastic pollution together with the plastisphere-associated ecological threats in coastal areas have aroused global concern. Tropical cyclones have been increased in both frequency and intensity under global warming, causing intense impact on the microplastics distribution and the structure of coastal ecosystems. However, until most currently, the extent to which typhoon impacts the microplastics and plastisphere community remains poorly known. This study analyzed the effects of Typhoon Wipha (Code: 1907) on microplastics abundance and composition in surface water and sediment crossed coastal areas of Shenzhen. Here we found a significant typhoon-induced increase in microplastics abundance in surface water, whereas an opposite trend was observed in sediment. Despite the evident transportation of microplastics from sediment to surface water by agitation, a possible microplastics influx was introduced by typhoon as evidenced by the large attribution of unknown force in source tracking analysis. Furthermore, typhoon had adeptly uniformed the plastisphere community in the sediment along the 190 km costal line overnight. A significant increase of nitrogen fixer, Bradyrhizobiaceae, was observed ubiquitously after typhoon, which might alter the nitrogen cycling and increase eutrophic condition of the coastal ecological system. Together, this study expanded the knowledge about the impact of typhoon-induced influx of the microplastics on coastal biogeochemical cycling. Moreover, the microplastics and the plastisphere compositional pattern revealed here will underpin future studies on adsorption behavior, interfacial processes and ecotoxicity of the coastal microplastic pollution.

TI Groundwater sustainability and groundwater/surface-water interaction in
   arid Dunhuang Basin, northwest China
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB The Dunhuang Basin, a typical inland basin in northwestern China, suffers a net loss of groundwater and the occasional disappearance of the Crescent Lake. Within this region, the groundwater/surface-water interactions are important for the sustainability of the groundwater resources. A three-dimensional transient groundwater flow model was established and calibrated using MODFLOW 2000, which was used to predict changes to these interactions once a water diversion project is completed. The simulated results indicate that introducing water from outside of the basin into the Shule and Danghe rivers could reverse the negative groundwater balance in the Basin. River-water/groundwater interactions control the groundwater hydrology, where river leakage to the groundwater in the Basin will increase from 3,114 x 10(4) m(3)/year in 2017 to 11,875 x 10(4) m(3)/year in 2021, and to 17,039 x 10(4) m(3)/year in 2036. In comparison, groundwater discharge to the rivers will decrease from 3277 x 10(4) m(3)/year in 2017 to 1857 x 10(4) m(3)/year in 2021, and to 510 x 10(4) m(3)/year by 2036; thus, the hydrology will switch from groundwater discharge to groundwater recharge after implementing the water diversion project. The simulation indicates that the increased net river infiltration due to the water diversion project will raise the water table and then effectively increasing the water level of the Crescent Lake, as the lake level is contiguous with the water table. However, the regional phreatic evaporation will be enhanced, which may intensify soil salinization in the Dunhuang Basin. These results can guide the water allocation scheme for the water diversion project to alleviate groundwater depletion and mitigate geo-environmental problem.

TI Tracking annual changes of coastal tidal flats in China during 1986-2016
   through analyses of Landsat images with Google Earth Engine
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB Tidal flats (non-vegetated area), along with coastal vegetation area, constitute the coastal wetlands (intertidal zone) between high and low water lines, and play an important role in wildlife, biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles. However, accurate annual maps of coastal tidal flats over the last few decades are unavailable and their spatio-temporal changes in China are unknown. In this study, we analyzed all the available Landsat TM/ETM +/OLI imagery (-44,528 images) using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform and a robust decision tree algorithm to generate annual frequency maps of open surface water body and vegetation to produce annual maps of coastal tidal flats in eastern China from 1986 to 2016 at 30-m spatial resolution. The resulting map of coastal tidal flats in 2016 was evaluated using very high-resolution images available in Google Earth. The total area of coastal tidal flats in China in 2016 was about 731,170 ha, mostly distributed in the provinces around Yellow River Delta and Pearl River Delta. The interannual dynamics of coastal tidal flats area in China over the last three decades can be divided into three periods: a stable period during 1986-1992, an increasing period during 1993-2001 and a decreasing period during 2002-2016. The resulting annual coastal tidal flats maps could be used to support sustainable coastal zone management policies that preserve coastal ecosystem services and biodiversity in China.

TI Multi-Elements in Source Water (Drinking and Surface Water) within Five
   Cities from the Semi-Arid and Arid Region, NW China: Occurrence, Spatial
   Distribution and Risk Assessment
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB The purpose of this study was to identify the concentration of multi-elements (MEs) in source water (surface and drinking water) and assess their quality for sustainability. A total of 161 water samples including 88 tap drinking waters (DW) and 73 surface waters (SW) were collected from five cities in Xi'an, Yan'an, Xining, Lanzhou, and Urumqi in northwestern China. Eighteen parameters including pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total organic carbon (TOC) total nitrogen (TN), chemical compositions of anions (F-, Cl-, NO3-, HCO3-, SO42-), cations (NH4+, K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+), and metals (lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu)) were analyzed in the first time at the five cities. The results showed that pH values and concentrations of Cl-, SO42-, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Cd, Cr, Cu in DW were within the permissible limits of the Chinese Drinking Water Quality Criteria, whereas the concentrations of other ions (F-, NO3-, NH4+ and Pb) exceeded their permissible values. In terms of the SW, the concentrations of F-, Cl-, NO3-, SO42- were over the third range threshold i.e., water suitable for fishing and swimming of the Surface Water Quality Standards in China. The spatial distributions of most MEs in source water are similar, and there was no clear variation for all ions and metals. The metals in DW may be caused by water pipes, faucets and their fittings. The noncarcinogenic risk of metals in DW for local children are in decreasing order Cr > Cd > Pb > Cu. The carcinogenic risk from Cr exposure was at the acceptable level according to threshold of USEPA. Although the comprehensive index of potential ecological assessment of Cr, Cd, Pb and Cu in SW ranked at low risk level and was in the order of Huang River in Xining > Peaceful Canal in Urumqi > Yan River in Yan'an > Yellow River in Lanzhou, their adverse effects to ecology and human health at a low concentration in local semi-arid and arid areas should not be ignored in the long run.

TI Seasonal variability in the distribution of microplastics in the coastal
   ecosystems and in some commercially important fishes of the Gulf of
   Mannar and Palk Bay, Southeast coast of India
SO REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB Impact of microplastic pollution on the marine environment and its biota is a major concern globally. Gulf of Mannar (GoM) and Palk Bay (PB) are two important biodiversity hotspots along the south-east coast of India. However, in the recent years the intense tourism and fishery activities have made the ecosystem and biota of these two ecologically significant coastal zones vulnerable to microplastic contamination. Hence, a comparative study on the seasonal distribution of microplastics in the surface waters, sediments, and in commercially important fishes were conducted to evaluate the threats imposed by microplastics on the environment and biota of both these coastal ecosystems. Microplastic distribution in the surface waters and sediments of GoM and PB exhibited conspicuous seasonal variation and showed positive correlation with the seasonal current patterns. In the surface waters of GoM, microplastics were abundant during the South West Monsoon whereas in PB it was high during the Early Winter Monsoon period. In the sediments of PB, microplastics was more during Spring Inter-monsoon and South West Monsoon whereas in GoM it was high during Late Winter Monsoon. Fragments, of size 1 to 5 mm formed the abundant microplastic type in the surface waters whereas in the sediments, fragments of size < 1 mm dominated. Of the gut content of the 613 fishes belonging to 12 families examined, microplastics were more in pelagic than demersal fishes with higher incidences in the family Clupeidae (42%). Among the fishes studied, microplastic ingestion was more in Selaroides leptolepis (27.77%), Sphyraena sp. (14.28%), Pelates quadrilineatus (12%), Caranx sp. (10.34%), and Sphyraena barracuda (10%).

Climate change represents a new and serious threat to marine ecosystems, but, to date, few studies have specifically considered how to design MPA networks to be resilient to this emerging threat. Here, we compile the best available information on MPA network design and supplement it with specific recommendations for building resilience into these networks. We provide guidance on size, spacing, shape, risk spreading (representation and replication), critical areas, connectivity, and maintaining ecosystem function to help MPA planners and managers design MPA networks that are more robust in the face of climate-change impacts.

TI Role of tectonics and climate on elevated arsenic in fluvial systems:
   Insights from surface water and sediments along regional transects of
   Chile
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Globally, arsenic (As) contamination is widespread in hydrological systems and the link between As enrichment and regional tectonic and climatic factors is still not well understood in orogenic environments. This work provides new insights on the relationship between As, tectonics, and climate by assessing the hydrochemistry of Chile, an active subduction zone with highly diverse natural settings. Selected study sites include fluvial courses along four regional transects connecting the Chilean coast to the Andes Cordillera in the northern, central, and southern areas of the country.The results indicate that As concentrations in surface water and fluvial sediments show a general positive correlation to crustal thickness and they tend to decrease progressively from northern to southern Chile. In contrast, As concentrations are negatively correlated to average annual precipitation which shows a significant increase toward southern Chile. From a regional tectonic perspective, northern Chile presents greater Andes shortening and higher crustal thicknesses, which induces increased crustal contamination and As content at the surface. Extremely low precipitation rates are also tied to local As enrichment and a sediment-starved trench that might favor higher plate coupling and shortening. On the contrary, decreased shortening of the Andes in southern Chile and related lower crustal thickness induces lower crustal contamination, thus acting as an As-poor provenance for surficial sediments and surface water. High precipitation rates further induce dilution of surface water, potential mobilization from the solid phase, and a significant amount of trench sediments that could induce lower plate coupling and lower shortening.At the local scale, a low potential for As mobilization was found in northern Chile where a greater distribution of As-bearing minerals was observed in sediments, mostly as finer particles (<63 mu m). The abundance of Fe -oxides potentially acts as a secondary surficial sink of As under the encountered physicochemical conditions.

TI A Model-Based Approach for Improving Surface Water Quality Management in
   Aquaculture Using MIKE 11: A Case of the Long Xuyen Quadangle, Mekong
   Delta, Vietnam
SO WATER
AB This study utilized MIKE 11 to quantify the spatio-temporal dynamics of water quality parameters (Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5), Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and temperature) in the Long Xuyen Quadrangle area of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Calibrated for the year of 2019 and validated for the year of 2020, the developed model showed a significant agreement between the observed and simulated values of water quality parameters. Locations near to cage culture areas exhibited higher BOD5 values than sites close to pond/lagoon culture areas due to the effects of numerous point sources of pollution, including upstream wastewater and out-fluxes from residential and tourism activities in the surrounding areas, all of which had a direct impact on the quality of the surface water used for aquaculture. Moreover, as aquacultural effluents have intensified and dispersed over time, water quality in the surrounding water bodies has degraded. The findings suggest that the effective planning, assessment and management of rapidly expanding aquaculture sites should be improved, including more rigorous water quality monitoring, to ensure the long-term sustainable expansion and development of the aquacultural sector in the Long Xuyen Quadrangle in particular, and the Vietnamese Mekong Delta as a whole.

AB Surface water is a critical resource in semi-arid areas. The Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) of Australia, one of the largest semi-arid basins in the world is aiming to set a worldwide example of how to balance multiple interests (i.e. environment, agriculture and urban use), but has suffered significant water shrinkages during the Millennium Drought (1999-2009), followed by extensive flooding. Baseline information and systematic quantification of surface water (SW) extent and flooding dynamics in space and time are needed for managing SW resources across the basin but are currently lacking.
   To synoptically quantify changes in SW extent and flooding dynamics over MDB, we used seasonally continuous Landsat TM and ETM+ data (1986 - 2011) and generic machine learning algorithms. We further mapped flooded forest at a riparian forest site that experienced severe tree dieback due to changes in flooding regime. We used a stratified sampling design to assess the accuracy of the SW product across time.
   Accuracy assessment yielded an overall classification accuracy of 99.94%, with producer's and user's accuracy of SW of 85.4% and 97.3%, respectively. Overall accuracy was the same for Landsat 5 and 7 data but user's and producer's accuracy of water were higher for Landsat 7 than 5 data and stable over time
   Our validated results document a rapid loss in SW bodies. The number, size, and total area of SW showed high seasonal variability with highest numbers in winter and lowest numbers in summer. SW extent per season per year showed high interannual and seasonal variability, with low seasonal variability during the Millennium Drought.
   Examples of current uses of the new dataset will be presented and include (1) assessing ecosystem response to flooding with implications for environmental water releases, one of the largest investment in environment in Australia; (2) quantifying drivers of SW dynamics (e.g. climate, human activity); (3) quantifying changes in SW dynamics and connectivity for water dependent organisms; (4) assessing the impact of flooding on riparian vegetation health. The approach developed here is globally applicable, relevant to areas with competing water demands (e.g. Okavango River delta, Mekong River Basin). Future work should incorporate Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data for continued quantification of SW dynamics.

TI Mapping Dynamic Water Fraction under the Tropical Rain Forests of the
   Amazonian Basin from SMOS Brightness Temperatures
SO WATER
AB Inland surface waters in tropical environments play a major role in the water and carbon cycle. Remote sensing techniques based on passive, active microwave or optical wavelengths are commonly used to provide quantitative estimates of surface water extent from regional to global scales. However, some of these estimates are unable to detect water under dense vegetation and/or in the presence of cloud coverage. To overcome these limitations, the brightness temperature data at L-band frequency from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission are used here to estimate flood extent in a contextual radiative transfer model over the Amazon Basin. At this frequency, the signal is highly sensitive to the standing water above the ground, and the signal provides information from deeper vegetation density than higher-frequencies. Three-day and (25 km x 25 km) resolution maps of water fraction extent are produced from 2010 to 2015. The dynamic water surface extent estimates are compared to altimeter data (Jason-2), land cover classification maps (IGBP, GlobeCover and ESA CCI) and the dynamic water surface product (GIEMS). The relationships between the water surfaces, precipitation and in situ discharge data are examined. The results show a high correlation between water fraction estimated by SMOS and water levels from Jason-2 (R > 0.98). Good spatial agreements for the land cover classifications and the water cycle are obtained.

TI Sustainable Surface Water Storage Development Pathways and Acceptable
   Limits for River Basins
SO WATER
AB This paper addresses the questions of acceptable upper limits for storage development and how best to deploy storage capacity in the long-term planning of built surface water storage in river basins. Storage-yield curves are used to establish sustainable storage development pathways and limits for a basin under a range of environmental flow release scenarios. Optimal storage distribution at a sub-basin level, which complies with an identified storage development pathway, can also be estimated. Two new indices are introduced-Water Supply Sustainability and Environmental Flow Sustainability-to help decide which pathways and management strategies are the most appropriate for a basin. Average pathways and conservative and maximum storage limits are illustrated for two example basins. Conservative and maximum withdrawal limits from storage are in the range of 45-50% and 60-65% of the mean annual runoff. The approach can compare the current level of basin storage with an identified pathway and indicate which parts of a basin are over- or under-exploited. A global storage-yield-reliability relationship may also be developed using statistics of annual basin precipitation to facilitate water resource planning in ungauged basins.

TI Climate impacts on the landings of Indian oil sardine over the
   south-eastern Arabian Sea
SO FISH AND FISHERIES
AB The landings of Indian oil sardine (Sardinella longiceps, Clupeidae) along the south-eastern Arabian Sea are about 43.8% of total Indian oil sardine production. The annual landings of this species exhibit large-scale variability with prolonged years of surplus or deficit landings without identified reason. Evaluating Indian oil sardine landings along the Kerala coast during 1961-2017 in relation to environmental variations, we have elucidated a putative link between variability in landings versus environmental parameters and climate indices. The variables examined in this study, such as salinity and temperature along with physical indices such as upwelling and mixed layer depth (MLD) of the ocean help to propose a mechanism to temporal variability in the landings of Indian oil sardine. Colder temperature and timely intense upwelling lead to nutrient enrichment in the surface water, which promotes the growth of phytoplankton (chl-a) and thereby food availability to Indian oil sardine are found during years with surplus catch. Less saline surface waters and shoaling of MLD at these times could lead to the aggregation of fish at particular depths and thereby a good catches. The reverse mechanism, such as more surface saline water, warm temperature, downwelling or weak upwelling, and less nutrient enrichment, leads to deficit landings. Further, it was noticed that the Pacific decadal oscillation and Atlantic multidecadal oscillation have a more pronounced impact on Indian oil sardine landings over the coast of south-eastern Arabian Sea than previously reported ENSO associated impacts. All these point towards climate change implications for the Indian oil sardine fishery.

TI Why groundwater matters: an introduction for policy-makers and managers
SO POLICY STUDIES
AB In many parts of the world the combined pressures of population growth and a drying climate have resulted in the proliferation of water focused policies which aim to increase the resilience of socio-ecological systems. Until recently, these policies often reflected surface water centric views of water resources, with groundwater receiving scant attention. In this paper we provide an introduction to the importance of groundwater for water-dependent socio-ecological systems and why it needs to be better incorporated into environmental water management policies. Specifically we highlight the key role of groundwater in buffering the environment and socio-economic activities against drought. We also outline some of the key challenges that face policy-makers and managers implementing groundwater management policies. These include dealing with groundwater resources that are spatially and temporally mismatched with surface water resources; transboundary governance issues; challenges between focusing on either preventative or restorative actions and most importantly limited knowledge about groundwater resources and groundwater-ecology relationships. We hope that the information in this paper will assist in the development of sustainable surface-groundwater water management policies, as well as highlight important challenges that should be considered before implementing groundwater related policies.

TI Estimating surface water concentrations of "down-the-drain" chemicals in
   China using a global model
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Predictions of surface water exposure to "down-the-drain" chemicals are presented which employ grid-based spatially-referenced data on average monthly runoff, population density, country-specific per capita domestic water and substance use rates and sewage treatment provision. Water and chemical load are routed through the landscape using flow directions derived from digital elevation data, accounting for in-stream chemical losses using simple first order kinetics. Although the spatial and temporal resolution of the model are relatively coarse, the model still has advantages over spatially inexplicit "unit-world" approaches, which apply arbitrary dilution factors, in terms of predicting the location of exposure hotspots and the statistical distribution of concentrations. The latter can be employed in probabilistic risk assessments. Here the model was applied to predict surface water exposure to "down-the-drain" chemicals in China for different levels of sewage treatment provision. Predicted spatial patterns of concentration were consistent with observed water quality classes for China. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Theoretical implications of best management practices for reducing the
   risk of drinking water contamination with Cryptosporidium from grazing
   cattle
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB A synthesis of the literature on the incidence of Cryptosporidium parvum in cattle, the fate of both feces and C. parvum in the environment, and the implications for BMP to alter both the incidence of exposure of surface water sources to C. parvwn contaminated feces and its fate was conducted. The results reveal that cattle are a possible source of C. parvum contamination to surface water sources in mixed-use watersheds. In a worst case scenario, surface water sources could be exposed to a load of up to 300 x 10(10) C. parvum oocysts per day in a herd of 300 cow-calf pairs. This would theoretically pose a threat to human health. Six proposed best management practices (BMPs) were examined to determine if they could theoretically reduce the magnitude of the risk that cattle grazing in multiuse water sheds might pose. The BMP of scheduling the access of cattle such that no calves younger than three months of age are permitted near sensitive riparian areas in community watersheds, provided global risk minimization regardless of the site specific BMPs used. Other BMPs including off-stream watering, stubble height management in key areas and silvopasture with off stream watering reduce the risk of C. parvum entering surface waters in amounts high enough to cause a risk to drinking water consumers. The BMP of fencing and nose holes to restrict access may be problematic as these create corridors and damage the riparian habitat if they are placed incorrectly. Overall, any risks that are inherent to allowing cattle to graze on the land in multiuse watersheds can be minimized with the use of several best management practices.

SO INLAND WATERS
AB High quality water is vital for human life, and ensuring its availability is a basic requirement and a major societal aim. The Water Framework Directive (WFD; 2000/60/EC) is a key piece of legislation for the protection and sustainable use of water in the European Union. In this work we briefly review the WFD directive and the current status of European inland surface waters. Additionally, we summarize major challenges and threats for the biological assessment of inland surface waters under climate change effects and invasion by alien species, and highlight the emerging tools and approaches that might help improve biological assessments, including molecular indices based on environmental DNA (eDNA), to new data from the Earth Observation programmes, and data-sharing platforms. Finally, we present recommendations to improve monitoring systems and assessments in the context of the WFD. Developments in this field may increase the likelihood of assuring high quality water for society.

TI Novel insights into source apportionment of dissolved organic matter in
   aquifer affected by anthropogenic groundwater recharge: Applicability of
   end-member mixing analysis based optical indices
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The composition and main sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in groundwater may change significantly under long-term anthropogenic groundwater recharge (AGR); however, the impact of AGR on quantitative sources of groundwater DOM has seldom been reported. This study evaluated the applicability of optical indices combined with mixing stable isotope analysis in R (MixSIAR) in end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) of groundwater DOM. Fluorescent indices, including C1%, C2%, and C3%, were more sensitive to AGR than other absorbance indices, as indicated by the significant difference between the dominant area of artificial groundwater recharged by surface water and the dominant area of natural groundwater recharged by atmospheric precipitation (NGRP). BIX-C1% was selected as the optimal dual index after the screening protocol of groundwater DOM for EMMA. Our results showed that DOM in the aquifer was mainly subject to autochthonous DOM and the contribution of background groundwater to AGRSW and NGRP groundwater accounted for 36.15% +/- 32.41% and 55.46% +/- 37.17% (p < 0.05), respectively. Therefore, AGR significantly changed the native DOM in the groundwater. In allochthonous sources of DOM, sewage and surface water contributed 29.54% +/- 24.87% and 21.32% +/- 28.08%, and 24.79% +/- 15.56% and 15.21% +/- 14.20% to AGRSW and NGRP groundwater, respectively. The contribution of surface water to AGRSW groundwater was significantly higher than that to NGRP groundwater (p < 0.05), indicating that AGR introduced significantly more DOM from surface water to groundwater. This study provides novel insights into the quantitative source apportionment of DOM in groundwater under long-term AGR, which will facilitate the environmental risk assessment of present AGR measures and the sustainable management of clean water.

TI PESTICIDE DISTRIBUTION AND ECOTOXICOLOGICAL RISK IN THE AYUQUILA-ARMERIA
   RIVER
SO REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE CONTAMINACION AMBIENTAL
AB Pesticides make an important contribution to increased global agricultural production; however, their intensive use represents a risk to biota in both the short and long terms. The physical and chemical characteristics of these compounds, as well as their versatility in agricultural, domestic, and public health use, have led them to become widely present in the environment. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the spatiotemporal distribution of pesticides in the surface water of the Ayuquila-Armeria river and to conduct an ecotoxicological risk assessment in algae, macroinvertebrates, and fish. The presence of 11 analytes was determined, being.-cyhalothrin, ametrine, and malathion the pesticides with highest concentrations, and carbendazim, malathion, and glyphosate those with the highest frequency of detection (> 70 %). The number of pesticides detected per sample presented no significant temporal differences, and there was no significant effect of the crops or vegetation adjacent to the study sites on the number of pesticides detected per sample. The sampling conducted in November 2019 (wet season) presented the greatest difference in concentrations of most pesticides, compared to the other samplings. The ecotoxicological risk assessment showed that the macroinvertebrates (Daphnia magna) are the most vulnerable to the concentrations of pesticides in surface water, followed by fish and algae. Regulation of the importation, trade, and management of malathion and lambda-cyhalothrin is crucial in order to reduce the presence of their residues and the risks associated with them.

TI Emerging contaminant occurrence and toxic effects on zebrafish embryos
   to assess the adverse effects caused by mixtures of substances in the
   environment
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) have been receiving global attention due to their worldwide presence in water bodies. The CECs could be originated from synthetic or natural sources, and they are not commonly monitored, although these substances are continuously reaching the aquatic environment. The main goal of this study was to determine the occurrence of some target CECs in Sao Paulo state surface water, once there is practically no information on the presence and concentration range of these substances at the studied sites. In addition, the present study aimed to assess adverse effects in the non-target fish embryo of Danio rerio (zebrafish) after exposure to surface water organic extract samples during 96 h using FET test. The CECs in surface water samples were determined by solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography coupled by mass spectrometry. A 2-year study was assessed in 7 rivers and 3 reservoirs at Sao Paulo state, where 25 of the 30 analyzed substances were quantified, being caffeine the substance with the highest concentration range (5.5 ng L-1 to 69 mu g L-1) and detected in 95% of analyzed samples, followed by bisphenol A (6.5-1300 ng L-1) and carbendazim (4.7-285 ng L-1), found in 50% and 85% of the analyzed samples, respectively. The chemical analysis and biological test were not performed in order to show a direct relationship between concentrations and observed effects on embryos; however, the combined approach can provide a better understanding of the adverse effects caused by mixtures of substances at relevant environmental concentrations. Regarding the adverse effects, it was observed that in the samples from sites with higher anthropogenic activity in the surroundings, there was also a higher mortality rate in organisms. At the Ribeirao Pires River and Sapucai-Guacu River, the mortality rate during the 2-year study was 21.6% and 9.3%, respectively. The morphological abnormality rates were higher at Ribeirao Grande (21.4%) and Ribeirao Pires (29.5%) Rivers. The obtained results aim to show that even in low concentrations (ng-mu g L-1) the CECs can cause adverse effects on non-target species, and because of that, new chemical indicators would be important to monitor the water quality and protect the aquatic biota.

AB Microplastic contamination of the marine environment has garnered global attention in recent years, and its distribution and effects in many small island developing states (SIDS) are still undetermined. As such, this study serves to detail an investigation of the abundance, spatial distribution and characteristics of surface water microplastics in the Kingston Harbour, a heavily polluted embayment in Jamaica. Fortnightly sampling with a manta trawl (335 jtm mesh) revealed non-variable concentrations of 0-5.73 particles/m(3) (0-2,697,674.13 particles/km(2)) across stations adjacent to mangrove forests, key nursery grounds for many commercially important finfish and shellfish. Microplastics found in samples were predominantly fragments and were between 1 mm and 2.5 mm. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy identified polyethylene and polypropylene in fragments selected for analysis. These data serve to establish a crucial baseline of the status of microplastic pollution in Kingston Harbour. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Big Data and Multiple Methods for Mapping Small Reservoirs: Comparing
   Accuracies for Applications in Agricultural Landscapes
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Whether or not reservoirs contain water throughout the dry season is critical to avoiding late season crop failure in seasonally-arid agricultural landscapes. Locations, volumes, and temporal dynamics, particularly of small (<1 Mm(3)) reservoirs are poorly documented globally, thus making it difficult to identify geographic and intra-annual gaps in reservoir water availability. Yet, small reservoirs are the most vulnerable to drying out and often service the poorest of farmers. Using the transboundary Volta River Basin (similar to 413,000 sq km) in West Africa as a case study, we present a novel method to map reservoirs and quantify the uncertainty of Landsat derived reservoir area estimates, which can be readily applied anywhere in the globe. We applied our method to compare the accuracy of reservoir areas that are derived from the Global Surface Water Monthly Water History (GSW) dataset to those that are derived when surface water is classified on Landsat 8 OLI imagery using the Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified NDWI with band 6 (MNDWI1), and Modified NDWI with band 7 (MNDWI2). We quantified how the areal accuracies of reservoir size estimates vary with the water classification method, reservoir properties, and environmental context, and assessed the options and limitations of using uncertain reservoir area estimates to monitor reservoir dynamics in an agricultural context. Results show that reservoir area estimates that are derived from the GSW data are 19% less accurate for our study site than MNDWI1 derived estimates, for a sample of 272 reservoir extents of 0.09 to 72 ha. The accuracy of Landsat-derived estimates improves with reservoir size and perimeter-area ratio, while accuracy may decline as surface vegetation increases. We show that GSW derived reservoir area estimates can provide an upper limit for current reservoir capacity and seasonal dynamics of larger reservoirs. Data gaps and uncertainties make GSW derived reservoir extents unsuitable for monitoring reservoirs that are smaller than 5.1 ha (holding similar to 49,759 m(3)), which constitute 674 (56%) reservoirs in the Volta basin, or monitoring seasonal fluctuations of most small reservoirs, limiting its utility for agricultural planning. This study is one of the first to test the utility and limitations of the newly available GSW dataset and provides guidance on the conditions under which this, and other Landsat-based surface water maps, can be reliably used to monitor reservoir resources.

TI Ecological monitoring of the fresh waters in Stara Zagora Region,
   Bulgaria I. Quality analyses of nitrogen compounds contents
SO DESALINATION
AB The aim of the present study was the ecological monitoring of the natural waters in Stara Zagora Region, Bulgaria, establishing of a database and correlations regarding three basic parameters - nitrates, nitrites and ammonium, to provide a framework for sustainable management of the natural surface and groundwaters in the stated region. To accomplish this goal, the concentrations of nitrogen compounds in real surface and groundwater samples taken from 16 sampling points situated in four municipalities of Stara Zagora Region were spectrophotometrically determined and the statistical significance of the data was tested.
   The results obtained displayed that nitrite-nitrogen could be classified as a potential pollutant in the surface waters from Stara Zagora and Chirpan municipalities. NH4+-N concentrations were in the range of 0.118-0.462 mg L-1 in 6 of the samples, thus pertaining to II category surface waters. The comparative analyses proved that nitrate-nitrogen could not be classified as a contaminant. The derived exponential correlation between NO3--N and NO2--N concentrations in Tundzha River allows mathematical modelling of the results. The present study ascertained that the pollution thresholds for groundwaters, regarding nitrite and nitrates, were exceeded in three sampling points from Stara Zagora and Chirpan municipalities.

TI Upgraded global mapping information for earth system modelling: an
   application to surface water depth at the ECMWF
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB Water bodies influence local weather and climate, especially in lake-rich areas. The FLake (Fresh-water Lake model) parameterisation is employed in the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model which is used operationally to produce global weather predictions. Lake depth and lake fraction are the main driving parameters in the FLake parameterisation. The lake parameter fields for the IFS should be global and realistic, because FLake runs over all the grid boxes, and then only lake-related results are used further. In this study new datasets and methods for generating lake fraction and lake depth fields for the IFS are proposed. The data include the new version of the Global Lake Database (GLDBv3) which contains depth estimates for unstudied lakes based on a geological approach, the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans and the Global Surface Water Explorer dataset which contains information on the spatial and temporal variability of surface water. The first new method suggested is a two-step lake fraction calculation; the first step is at 1 km grid resolution and the second is at the resolution of other grids in the IFS system. The second new method involves the use of a novel algorithm for ocean and inland water separation. This new algorithm may be used by anyone in the environmental modelling community. To assess the impact of using these innovations, in situ measurements of lake depth, lake water surface temperature and ice formation/disappearance dates for 27 lakes collected by the Finnish Environment Institute were used. A set of offline experiments driven by atmospheric forcing from the ECMWF ERAS Reanalysis were carried out using the IFS HTESSEL land surface model. In terms of lake depth, the new dataset shows a much lower mean absolute error, bias and error standard deviation compared to the reference set-up. In terms of lake water surface temperature, the mean absolute error is reduced by 13.4 %, the bias by 12.5 % and the error standard deviation by 20.3 %. Seasonal verification of the mixed layer depth temperature and ice formation/disappearance dates revealed a cold bias in the meteorological forcing from ERAS. Spring, summer and autumn verification scores confirm an overall reduction in the surface water temperature errors. For winter, no statistically significant change in the ice formation/disappearance date errors was detected.

TI Specific polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons identified as ecological risk
   factors in the Lagos lagoon, Nigeria
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB The ecological risk assessment (ERA) of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is imperative due to their ubiquity and biological effects in aquatic organisms. We evaluated the seasonal levels and ERA of 16 priority PAHs in surface water, sediment and fish from four (4) anthropogenic-impacted zones of the Lagos lagoon, Nigeria. PAHs were analysed using GC-FID and standard guidelines were utilized for the ERA. Also, we developed a sediment to water-PAHs ratio and ranking of PAHs for the ERA. The dominant fish species were Sarotherodon melanotheron (Black-Jawed Tilapia), Gerres melanopterus (Gerres), Liza falcipinnis (Sicklefin Mullet) and Pseudotolithus elongatus (Bobo Croaker) at Ilaje, Iddo, Atlas cove and Apapa zones respectively. The range of sum PAHs was 195-1006 mu g L-1, 302-1290 mu g kg(-1) and 8.80 -26.1 mu g kg(-1) in surface water, sediment and fish species respectively. Naphthalene was dominant in the surface water and sediment samples while 3-ring to 4-ring PAHs were predominant in fish species across the zones and seasons. The sediment to water-PAHs ratio was greater than 1 for sum PAHs and significantly higher (p <0.05) in the wet season for specific PAHs across the zones and seasons. On the basis of the sediment PAHs level, Apapa zone was highly polluted with frequent biological effects while the other zones were moderately polluted with occasional biological effects across the zones and seasons. Fish species from all zones were minimally contaminated in both seasons except S. melanotheron which was not contaminated. The specific PAHs identified as ecological risk factors in the lagoon and ranking based on 50-75% recurrence in the ERA were; naphthalene, acenaphthene > acenaphthylene, fluorene, pyrene and benzo[a]anthracene. We recommend that the specific PAHs identified should form the basis for the establishment of environmental quality standards for individual PAHs in coastal waters based on the UN sustainable development goal 14 (life below water).

SO GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
AB Rivers, lakes, and open water bodies play crucial roles in environmental development, especially in urban ecosystems. Accurate urban surface water body maps in high resolution are an important prerequisite for better and faster decision making for urban ecosystem monitoring, mitigating the effects of urban heat islands and urban climate change adaptation. Research presents new automatic algorithm for urban surface bodies mapping (AUWM). Algorithm was tested on Sentinel-2 data and can be applied globally for automatic mapping water bodies in 10-m spatial resolution. AUWM was developed based on modified normalized difference water index, pansharpening techniques (MNDWIPS), and k-means clustering algorithm. Research was provided on three study sites. The optimal number of classes for k-means in AUWM is four. Accuracy assessment results show that AUWM is a highly accurate method for water bodies mapping, confirmed by all statistical parameters; accuracy, kappa, precision, and F1 value are 0.997, 0.830, 0.998, and 0.998, respectively.

TI Continuous Monitoring of the Surface Water Area in the Yellow River
   Basin during 1986-2019 Using Available Landsat Imagery and the Google
   Earth Engine
SO ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB The Yellow River Basin (YRB) has been facing severe water shortages; hence, the long-term dynamic monitoring of its surface water area (SWA) is essential for the efficient utilization of its water resources and sustainable socioeconomic development. In order to detect the changing trajectory of the SWA of the YRB and its influencing factors, we used available Landsat images from 1986 through to 2019 and a water and vegetation indices-based method to analyze the spatial-temporal variability of four types of SWAs (permanent, seasonal, maximum and average extents), and their relationship with precipitation (Pre), temperature (Temp), leaf area index (LAI) and surface soil moisture (SM).The multi-year average permanent surface water area (SWA) and seasonal SWA accounted for 46.48% and 53.52% in the Yellow River Basin (YRB), respectively. The permanent and seasonal water bodies were dominantly distributed in the upper reaches, accounting for 70.22% and 48.79% of these types, respectively. The rate of increase of the permanent SWA was 49.82 km(2)/a, of which the lower reaches contributed the most (34.34%), and the rate of decrease of the seasonal SWA was 79.18 km(2)/a, of which the contribution of the source region was the highest (25.99%). The seasonal SWA only exhibited decreasing trends in 13 sub-basins, accounting for 15% of all of the sub-basins, which indicates that the decrease in the seasonal SWA was dominantly caused by the change in the SWA in the main river channel region. The conversions from seasonal water to non-water bodies, and from seasonal to permanent water bodies were the dominant trends from 1986 to 2019 in the YRB. The SWA was positively correlated with precipitation, and was negatively correlated with the temperature. Because the permanent and seasonal water bodies were dominantly distributed in the river channel region and sub-basins, respectively, the change in the permanent SWA was significantly affected by the regulation of the major reservoirs, whereas the change in the seasonal SWA was more closely related to climate change. The increase in the soil moisture was helpful in the formation of the permanent water bodies. The increased evapotranspiration induced by vegetation greening played a significant positive role in the SWA increase via the local cooling and humidifying effects, which offset the accelerated water surface evaporation caused by the atmospheric warming.

TI Monitoring and assessment of the seasonal and inter-annual pan
   inundation dynamics in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, Southern Africa
SO PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
AB In arid regions, pans form a critical water source that supports local communities, livestock, and wildlife, with readily available water resources. However, these waterbodies are unevenly distributed across the landscape and highly ephemeral and this influences their ability to provide water, especially in remote and water scarce areas. In addition, it remains difficult, impractical, and costly to monitor their variability using traditional hydrometric networks. In this regard, their contribution as water sources remains uncertain. The availability of spatially explicit data, with improved sensor design characteristics such as Landsat-8 enables the monitoring of their surface water extent over space and time. This study therefore, for the first time investigated the potential of using Landsat-8 in detecting and monitoring the spatial and temporal dynamics of pan inundation in the water scarce region of Kgalagadi in Southern Africa between 2016 and 2018. This was achieved by testing the performance of multiple indices, namely; the Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Automated Water Extraction Index for Shadow (AWEIsh), Water Ratio Index (WRI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI). Overall, the results have shown the potential of remote sensing data to monitor pan inundation. The MNDWI produced the highest overall classification accuracy of 84.91% comparatively. The MNDWI was then used for monitoring and assessing pan inundation dynamics over different seasons between 2016 and 2018. During the study period, pan inundation varied significantly (alpha = 0.05) for different seasons. Nevertheless, 2017 had the largest surface water extent covering 23 195.8 m(2), during the wet season and 17 913.3 m(2) in the dry season. On the other hand, 2018 showed the smallest spatial coverage of 13 076 m(2) for the wet season and 6032.587 m(2) during the dry season. The observed spatial variability in pan inundation was attributed to rainfall and temperature variability. The study thus revealed the utility of remotely sensed data sets in providing a more robust approach for monitoring seasonal and inter-annual pan inundation variations in semi-arid environments of Southern Africa. This information is important for water management decision making, specifically for water-limited areas, to conserve these water sources to ensure their sustainability in supporting local communities, livestock and wildlife population.

AB A student-centric research education program with the active participation of undergraduate students is initiated. The aim is to imbibe. responsible citizenship behavior" in them so that each member becomes conscious and well trained to take up environmental-related issues and challenges for long-term sustainability of the ecosystem. In this work, we report spectrophotometer-based estimation of hexavalent chromium (57-268 mu gL(-1)) and lead (34-158 mu gL(-1)) concentrations in different surface waters and groundwater samples in and around the city of Hyderabad, India. Our results indicate that the studied surface water bodies and aquifers are contaminated to variable degrees and pose a serious threat to the ecosystem. In view of low geochemical baseline values for chromium and lead, the origin of heavy metal pollution is inferred to be anthropogenic, mainly originating from industrial effluents. The toxicological data are integrated with health data for risk assessment and impending health hazard. Finally, the novelty of this student-centric research program is highlighted.

AB Climate change will impact elemental cycles; understanding such impacts can empower students to act toward sustainability and accountability. Fluxes of nitrogen contributing to campus ground and surface water pollution have not been studied in detail. This paper presents a water-based nitrogen budget for teaching, using the University of Minnesota campus as a model.
   We created three annual nitrogen budgets (2003-2005). Data were collected from interviews and published and unpublished papers. All ground or surface water nitrogen fluxes were considered. The campus represents a nitrogen sink; this could be due to nitrogen accumulation in soil, or to uncertainties in our estimation of gaseous losses or biological fixation pathways. More research is needed to assess accuracy and significance of this apparent sink. This paper shows that climate change will affect many elemental cycles; nitrogen perhaps most importantly. A water-based nitrogen budget is a unique approach to water pollution which could be used on university campuses to guide campus-mediated nitrogen pollution and promote sustainability.

TI Current wastewater treatment targets are insufficient to protect surface
   water quality
SO COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
AB The quality of global water resources is increasingly strained by socio-economic developments and climate change, threatening both human livelihoods and ecosystem health. With inadequately managed wastewater being a key driver of deterioration, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.3 was established to halve the proportion of untreated wastewater discharged to the environment by 2030. Yet, the impact of achieving SDG6.3 on global ambient water quality is unknown. Addressing this knowledge gap, we develop a high-resolution surface water quality model for salinity as indicated by total dissolved solids, organic pollution as indicated by biological oxygen demand and pathogen pollution as indicated by fecal coliform. Our model includes a novel spatially-explicit approach to incorporate wastewater treatment practices, a key determinant of in-stream pollution. We show that achieving SDG6.3 reduces water pollution, but is still insufficient to improve ambient water quality to below key concentration thresholds in several world regions. Particularly in the developing world, reductions in pollutant loadings are locally effective but transmission of pollution from upstream areas still leads to water quality issues downstream. Our results highlight the need to go beyond the SDG-target for wastewater treatment in order to achieve the overarching goal of clean water for all.
   SGD 6.3 targets to half the proportion of untreated wastewater discharged to the environment by 2030 will substantially improve water quality globally, but a high-resolution surface water quality model suggests key thresholds will still not be met in regions with limited existing wastewater treatment.

TI The deep challenge of nitrate pollution in river water of China
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Nitrate pollution of surface water has attracted global attention, and the issue is becoming increasingly significant in China. To identify the pollution status, sources, and potential non-carcinogenic health risks of nitrate in China's river water, nitrate data from 71 major rivers from 30 provinces were systematically collected. The spatial distribution of nitrate concentrations in river water was analyzed, and the main nitrate pollution sources were revealed based on the presence of nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrate. The results show that approximately 7.83% of samples in China exceeded the national drinking water standard for nitrate (45 mg/L). The concentrations of nitrate in Mudan River (Linkou County), Haihe (Beijing), and Yangtze River estuary (Shanghai) exceed 90 mg/L, which indicates severe pollution. The characteristic values of delta N-15 and delta O-18 of river water in China range from -23.5 parts per thousand to 26.99 parts per thousand and - 12.7 parts per thousand to 83.5 parts per thousand, indicate many sources including inorganic fertilizer, soil nitrogen, wastewater or manure. The primary sources of nitrate in river water of Northeast, Northwest, Southwest, and South China were manure, septicwaste, inorganic fertilizer, and soil organic matter nitrification. Manure and septic waste were the major source of nitrate in Central, East, and North China. Correlation analysis revealed that the nitrate concentrations of surface water has a positive relationship with GDP, nitrogen fertilizer application usage, wastewater discharge, and population in China. Non-carcinogenic risk of nitratewas identified in 80% of the regions in China, and potential moderate non-carcinogenic risk areas are Shanghai, Beijing, and Shaanxi. It is urgent to solve the problem of pollution and prevent the further pollution of China's river water. Though the new "10-point Water Plan" issued by the Chinese government solved previous problems, it will take decades to control and repair polluted surface water. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

SO WATER RESEARCH
AB River flow regimes have been transformed by groundwater and surface water management operations globally, prompting widespread ecological responses. Yet, empirical evidence quantifying the simultaneous effects of groundwater and surface water management operations on freshwater ecosystems remains limited. This study combines a multi-decadal freshwater invertebrate dataset (1995-2016) with groundwater model outputs simulating the effects of different anthropogenic flow alterations (e.g. groundwater abstraction, effluent water returns) and river discharges. A suite of flow alteration- and flow-ecology relationships were modelled that tested different invertebrate community responses (taxonomic, functional, flow response guilds, individual taxa). Most flow alteration-ecology relationships were not statistically significant, highlighting the absence of consistent, detectable ecological responses to long-term water management operations. A small number of significant statistical models provided insights into how flow alterations transformed specific ecological assets; including Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa which are rheophilic in nature being positively associated with groundwater abstraction effects reducing river discharges by 0-15%. This represents a key finding from a water resource management operation perspective given that such flow alteration conditions were observed on average in over two-thirds of the study sites examined. In a small number of instances, specific invertebrate responses displayed relative declines associated with the most severe groundwater abstraction effects and artificial hydrological inputs (predominantly effluent water returns). The strongest flow-ecology relationships were recorded during spring months, when invertebrate communities were most responsive to antecedent minimum and maximum discharges, and average flow conditions in the preceding summer months. Results from this study provide new evidence indicating how groundwater and surface water resources can be managed to conserve riverine ecological assets. Moreover, the ensemble of flow alteration- and flow-ecology relationships established in this study could be used to guide environmental flow strategies. Such findings are of global importance given that future climatic change and rising societal water demands are likely to further transform river flow regimes and threaten freshwater ecosystems.

TI A satellite-based monitoring system for quantifying surface water and
   mesic vegetation dynamics in a semi-arid region
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB Semi-arid and arid systems cover one third of the earth's land surface, and are becoming increasingly drier, but existing datasets do not capture all of the types of water resources that sustain these systems. In semi-arid environments, small surface water bodies and areas of mesic vegetation (wetlands, wet meadows, riparian zones) function as critical water resources. However, the most commonly-used maps of water resources are derived from the Landsat time series or single date aerial photographs, and are too coarse either spatially or temporally to effectively monitor water resource dynamics. In this study, we produced a Sentinel Fusion (SF) water resources product for a semi-arid mountainous region of the western United States, which includes monthly maps of both a) surface water and b) mesic vegetation at 10 m spatial resolution using freely available Earth observation data on an open access platform. We applied random forest classifiers to optical data from the Sentinel-2 time series, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the Sentinel-1 time series, and topographic variables. We compared our SF product with three commonly used and publicly available datasets in the western U.S. We found that our surface water class contained fewer omission errors than a leading global surface water product in (94 % producer's accuracy (PA) vs 84 %) and comparable user's accuracy (UA) (91 % vs 97 %) with commission errors occurring largely in mixed water pixels. Our mesic vegetation class had up to 43 % higher PAs compared to the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) estimates and up to 78 % higher UAs over the Sage Grouse Initiative mesic resources maps during the most critical part of the water year. We found that while inclusion of SAR data from the C-band Sentinel-1 sensor consistently improved estimates of water resources in each of the last four months of the 2021 water year when compared to optical-only + topographic variables, only in September did those improvements lie outside of the 95 % confidence interval. With nine times finer spatial resolution and more frequent image collection, our SF maps characterize intra-annual dynamics of smaller water bodies (<30 m wide) and mesic vegetation integral to ecosystem functioning in semi-arid systems compared to leading Landsatderived products. Further, our workflow is easily reproducible using freely available data on an open access platform, and can be adopted to help guide land use decisions related to water resources by farmers, ranchers, and conservationists in semi-arid environments.

TI Microplastics in coastal and oceanic surface waters and their role as
   carriers of pollutants of emerging concern in marine organisms
SO MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Microplastics (Mps) pose a significant environmental challenge with global implications. To examine the effect of Mps on coastal and oceanic surface waters, as well as in marine organisms, 167 original research papers pub-lished between January 2013 and September 2022 were analyzed. The study revealed an unequal distribution of research efforts across the world. Fragments and fibers were the most frequently detected particles in ocean surface waters and marine biota, which mainly consisted of colored and transparent microparticles. Sampling of Mps was primarily done using collecting nets with a mesh size of 330 & mu;m. Most articles used a stereomicroscope and Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy for identification and composition determination, respectively. Polyethylene and polypropylene were the most frequent polymers found, both in coastal waters and in marine organisms. The major impact observed on marine organisms was a reduction in growth rate, an increase in mortality, and reduced food consumption. The hydrophobic nature of plastics encourages the formation of biofilms called the "plastisphere," which can carry pollutants that are often toxic and can enter the food chain. To better define management measures, it is necessary to standardize investigations that assess Mp pollution, considering not only the geomorphological and oceanographic features of each region but also the urban and industrial occupation of the studied marine environments.

TI Leveraging Hydrologic Accounting and Water Markets for Improved Water
   Management: The Case for a Central Clearinghouse
SO WATER
AB Effective management of water resources requires signaling the scarcity value of water to society. However, accurate signaling is often limited by incomplete and/or untimely accounting of hydrologic stores and flows of water. In this opinion piece, we advocate an incisive yet conceptually simple framework for transparent, real-time accounting of water stores and flows, including both groundwater and surface water, to inform water markets organized around a central clearinghouse. This framework promotes forthright collaboration among disciplines to improve system efficiency and increase water-management transparency. We use California water management as an example for the potential for a central clearinghouse framework that has proven so beneficial to transparency of energy markets in that region.

TI Major ions in drinking and surface waters from five cities in arid and
   semi-arid areas, NW China: spatial occurrence, water chemistry, and
   potential anthropogenic inputs
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB A total of 161 water samples were collected from five large and medium-sized city rivers and residential tap waters, Xi'an and Yan'an in Shaanxi province, Xining in Qinghai province, Lanzhou in Gansu, and Urumqi in Xinjiang province, within arid and semi-arid area (NW China). The pH, EC parameters, and concentrations of 10 major ions (F-, Cl-, HCO3-, NO3-, SO42-, NH4+, K+, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+) in the drinking waters (DWs) and surface waters (SWs) were analyzed to determine the ion chemistry, geochemical process, and potential anthropogenic input sources and to assess the water quality for drinking, domestic, and irrigation purposes. Durove diagrams and Gibbs diagram indicated that the ions Ca2+ and HCO3- dominant in DWs from Xi'an and Xining were of Ca2+-(HCO3- + SO42-) type, while sulfate and Na+ dominant in SWs, and Na+/K+-SO42- type was for Yan River in Yan'an and Peaceful Canal in Urumqi, their water chemistry influenced by evaporation and rock dominance, and evaporation and fractional crystallization, respectively. Meanwhile, Na+/K+/Ca2+-HCO3-/SO42- type dominated in Huang River in Xining and Yellow River in Lanzhou, which dominated by rock weathering. The quality assessments showed that in general the drinking waters were suitable for domestic purposes. However, the high values of NO3- at some sites influenced by agricultural and industrial inputs made it unsafe for drinking and demand detailed regional drinking water investigations. The assessment of SWs showed that the waters from Yan River in Yan'an and Yellow River in Lanzhou and Huang River in Xining would be used for irrigation. However, high values of SAR, Na%, RSC, and EC at sites in Peaceful Canal restricted suitability for irrigation, and not recommended for drinking water sources. It was noted that for the sustainable development of surface water, a reduction of discharge water from human activities and/or an increase in the fresh water inflow to the surface were needed.

TI Spatial and Temporal Distribution Characteristics of Nutrient Elements
   and Heavy Metals in Surface Water of Tibet, China and Their Pollution
   Assessment
SO WATER
AB In the context of global climate change, the ecological environment of Tibet has been gaining attention given its unique geographical and fragile nature. In this study, to understand the pollution status of the surface water of Tibet, China, we collected monthly data of 12 indicators from 41 cross-sectional monitoring sites in 2021 and analyzed the spatial and temporal variations of nutrients and heavy metal elements, water quality conditions, and pollutant sources in surface water. All 12 polluting elements, except lead (Pb), had significant seasonal variations, but the magnitude of the differences was very small. Spatially, nutrient elements were relatively concentrated in the agricultural and pastoral development areas in central and northern Tibet. In general, the water quality in most parts of Tibet was found to be good, and the water quality of 41 monitoring sections belonged to Class I water standard as per the entropy method-fuzzy evaluation method. The study used a multivariate statistical method to analyze the sources of pollution factors. The principal component analysis method identified four principal components. The results of this study can provide a scientific basis for pollution prevention and control in the Tibet Autonomous Region, and contribute to further research on water ecology.

TI Assessment of Groundwater Recharge in Agro-Urban Watersheds Using
   Integrated SWAT-MODFLOW Model
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Numerical models are employed widely to evaluate the hydrological components of a watershed but, traditionally, watershed models simplify either surface or subsurface flow module. In this setup, as a bridge between groundwater and surface water regimes, aquifer recharge is the most affected segment of the water balance. Since the watershed processes are increasingly changed, the need for a comprehensive model with detailed conceptualizing capacity of both groundwater and surface water flow systems is growing. This work focuses on the spatiotemporal groundwater recharge assessment in gauged and ungauged agro-urban watersheds in South Korea using the updated SWAT-MODFLOW model, which integrates the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT2012) and Newton-Raphson formulation for Modular Finite Difference Groundwater Flow (MODFLOW-NWT) in a single executable code. Before coupling, the setup, calibration, and verification of each model were performed separately. After integration, irrigation pumps and drain cells mapping to SWAT auto-irrigation and subbasins were initiated. Automatic calibration techniques were used for SWAT and MODFLOW-NWT models, but a manual calibration was used for the integrated model. A physical similarity approach was applied to transfer parameters to the ungauged watershed. Statistical model performance indicators revealed that the low streamflow estimation was improved in SWAT-MODFLOW. The spatiotemporal aquifer recharge distribution from both the stream seepage and precipitation showed a substantial change, and most of the aquifer recharge occurs in July-September. The areal annual average recharge reaches about 18% of the precipitation. Low-lying areas receive higher recharge consistently throughout a year. Overall, SWAT-MODFLOW exhibited reasonable versatility in evaluating watershed processes and produced valuable results with reasonable accuracy. The results can be an important input for policymakers in the development of sustainable groundwater protection and abstraction strategies for the region.

TI Modelling rotavirus concentrations in rivers: Assessing Uganda's present
   and future microbial water quality
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Faecal pathogens can be introduced into surface water through open defecation, illegal disposal and inadequate treatment of faecal sludge and wastewater. Despite sanitation improvements, poor countries are progressing slowly towards the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal 6 by 2030. Sanitation-associated pathogenic contamination of surface waters impacted by future population growth, urbanization and climate change receive limited attention. Therefore, a model simulating human rotavirus river inputs and concentrations was developed combining population density, sanitation coverage, rotavirus incidence, wastewater treatment and environmental survival data, and applied to Uganda. Complementary surface runoff and river discharge data were used to produce spatially explicit rotavirus outputs for the year 2015 and for two scenarios in 2050. Urban open defecation contributed 87%, sewers 9% and illegal faecal sludge disposal 3% to the annual 15.6 log10 rotavirus river inputs in 2015. Monthly concentrations fell between -3.7 (Q5) and 2.6 (Q95) log10 particles per litre, with 1.0 and 2.0 median and mean log10 particles per litre, respectively. Spatially explicit outputs on 0.0833 x 0.0833 degrees grids revealed hotspots as densely populated urban areas. Future population growth, urbanization and poor sanitation were stronger drivers of rotavirus concentrations in rivers than climate change. The model and scenario analysis can be applied to other locations.

TI Impact of late Quaternary environmental changes on deep-sea benthic
   foraminiferal faunas of the Red Sea
SO MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY
AB Fluctuations in abundance, diversity and species composition of benthic foraminifera from two sites of the northern and southern Red Sea indicate strong variability of deep-sea ecosystems during the last four glacial to interglacial cycles. In total, five and four different benthic foraminiferal assemblages have been identified in the northern core and southern core, respectively. Comparison with recent faunas from the Red Sea and adjacent oceans allowed the reconstruction of temporal changes in deep-water ventilation, salinity and food availability at the seafloor. Generally, the abundance of infaunal and miliolid taxa increase during glacial intervals indicating increased organic matter fluxes, oxygen decrease and salinity increase in deep waters during these times. These fluctuations are attributed to enhanced oxygen consumption rates and temporarily reduced deep-water formation in the northern Red Sea during glacial intervals. The recorded environmental changes are a reflection of both high- and low-latitude climate changes. The northern Red Sea is mainly influenced by glacio-eustatic sea level fluctuations that control deep-water formation rates and by mid-latitude climate changes of the Mediterranean region that control surface productivity. In contrast, deep-sea ecosystem variability of the southern Red Sea is additionally influenced by low-latitude climate changes attributed to the NE monsoon intensity that drives the inflow of nutrient-rich surface waters from the Gulf of Aden. These results demonstrate the high sensitivity of deep-sea ecosystems of the Red Sea to both global and regional climate changes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

TI Material flow analysis of the nitrogen loading to surface water of Miyun
   reservoir watershed under uncertainty
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Nitrogen (N) was one of the primary causes to water environment depravation, having a thorough understanding of N loading to water body is important for reducing the N pollution purposefully. In this research, we took the Miyun reservoir watershed as a typical area, of which a material flow model of the N metabolism was built. Afterwards, the material flow analysis (MFA) was conducted to identify the main pathways that generated N loading. And then the Monte Carlo (MC) method was applied to make uncertainty analysis of the N loading calculated through the MFA. The MFA results showed that the total N loading to surface water of the Miyun reservoir watershed was 5505.42 x 10(3) kg N, of which about 74.89% was originated from the agriculture subsystem (i.e., crop planting, fruit planting and vegetable planting subsystems). The main pathways of the agriculture subsystem that generated N loading were recognized as maize, chestnut, apple, pear, cabbage, cucumber and tomato planting. The uncertainty analysis results revealed that the N loading calculated from the MFA had some uncertainty, of which the fruit planting and industry subsystem had the biggest uncertainty, while the N loading from the fish farming subsystem had the lowest uncertainty. To make directed actions to protect the water quality of the Miyun reservoir watershed, the main pathways of each subsystem that generated N loading need to be regulated. This study provided a new framework of combing the MFA and MC method to simulate N loading to surface water at watershed scale, and was of vital significance to provide decision support for the watershed N pollution management globally.

TI Diverse and unique viruses discovered in the surface water of the East
   China Sea
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on earth and play import roles in marine biogeochemical cycles. Here, viral communities in the surface water of the East China Sea (ECS) were collected from three representative regions of Yangshan Harbor (YSH), Gouqi Island (GQI), and the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE) and explored primarily through epifluorescence microscopy (EM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and metagenomics analysis. Results The virus-like particles (VLPs) in the surface water of the ECS were measured to be 10(6)to 10(7)VLPs/ml. Most of the isolated viral particles possessed a head-and-tail structure, but VLPs with unique morphotypes that had never before been observed in the realm of viruses were also found. The sequences related to known viruses in GenBank accounted for 21.1-22.8% of the viromic datasets from YSH, GQI, and YRE. In total, 1029 viral species were identified in the surface waters of the ECS. Among them, tailed phages turn out to make up the majority of viral communities, however a small number ofPhycodnaviridaeorMimiviridaerelated sequences were also detected. The diversity of viruses did not appear to be a big difference among these three aquatic environments but their relative abundance was geographically variable. For example, thePelagibacterphage HTVC010P accounted for 50.4% of the identified viral species in GQI, but only 9.1% in YSH and 11.7% in YRE. Sequences, almost identical to those of uncultured marine thaumarchaeal dsDNA viruses and magroviruses that infect Marine Group II Euryarchaeota, were confidently detected in the ECS viromes. The predominant classes of virome ORFs with functional annotations that were found were those involved in viral biogenesis. Virus-host connections, inferred from CRISPR spacer-protospacer mapping, implied newly discovered infection relationships in response to arms race between them. Conclusions Together, both identified viruses and unknown viral assemblages observed in this study were indicative of the complex viral community composition found in the ECS. This finding fills a major gap in the dark world of oceanic viruses of China and additionally contributes to the better understanding of global marine viral diversity, composition, and distribution.

TI How Effective Are Existing Phosphorus Management Strategies in
   Mitigating Surface Water Quality Problems in the US?
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Phosphorus is an essential component of modern agriculture. Long-term land application of phosphorous-enriched fertilizers and animal manure leads to phosphorus accumulation in soil that may become susceptible to mobilization via erosion, surface runoff and subsurface leaching. Globally, highly water-soluble phosphorus fertilizers used in agriculture have contributed to eutrophication and hypoxia in surface waters. This paper provides an overview of the literature relevant to the advances in phosphorous management strategies and surface water quality problems in the U.S. Over the past several decades, significant advances have been made to control phosphorus discharge into surface water bodies of the U.S. However, the current use of phosphorus remains inefficient at various stages of its life cycle, and phosphorus continues to remain a widespread problem in many water bodies, including the Gulf of Mexico and Lake Erie. In particular, the Midwestern Corn Belt region of the U.S. is a hotspot of phosphorous fertilization that has resulted in a net positive soil phosphorous balance. The runoff of phosphorous has resulted in dense blooms of toxic, odor-causing phytoplankton that deteriorate water quality. In the past, considerable attention was focused on improving the water quality of freshwater bodies and estuaries by reducing inputs of phosphorus alone. However, new research suggests that strategies controlling the two main nutrients, phosphorus and nitrogen, are more effective in the management of eutrophication. There is no specific solution to solving phosphorus pollution of water resources; however, sustainable management of phosphorus requires an integrated approach combining at least a reduction in consumption levels, source management, more specific regime-based nutrient criteria, routine soil fertility evaluation and recommendations, transport management, as well as the development of extensive phosphorus recovery and recycling programs.

   variations in hydrologic time series in the southwestern United States
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB A new method for frequency analysis of hydrologic time series was developed to facilitate the estimation and reconstruction of individual or groups of frequencies from hydrologic time-series and facilitate the comparison of these isolated time-series components across data types, between different hydrologic settings within a watershed, between watersheds, and across frequencies. While climate-related variations in inflow to and outflow from aquifers have often been neglected, the development and management of ground-water and surface-water resources has required the inclusion of the assessment of the effects of climatic variability on the supply and demand and sustainability of use. The regional assessment of climatic variability of surface-water and ground-water flow throughout the southwestern United States required this new systematic method of hydrologic time-series analysis.
   To demonstrate the application of this new method, six hydrologic time-series from the Mojave River Basin, California were analyzed. The results indicate that climatic variability exists in all the data types and are partially coincident with known climate cycles such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. The time-series also indicate lagged correlations between tree-ring indices, streamflow, stream base flow, and ground-water levels. These correlations and reconstructed time-series can be used to better understand the relation of hydrologic response to climatic forcings and to facilitate the simulation of streamflow and ground-water recharge for a more realistic approach to water-resource management.

TI Oxygen isotope application in paleotemperature reconstruction and water
   cycle in the deep time
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
AB Suitable temperature is the most important environmental parameter for the habitability of the Earth. The oxygen isotope composition of carbonate and phosphate fossils is the most widely used technique for reconstructing deep-time seawater temperatures. However, this technique is subject to uncertainties including diagenetic alteration, the vital isotope fractionation effects, regional variations in seawater oxygen isotope composition, and whether the latter changes with time in the geological past. In this contribution, we evaluated these constraints and solutions for these uncertainties. Our evaluation shows the rigorously screened oxygen isotope data provide the most continuous and reliable paleotemperature record of the Phanerozoic, generally consistent with climate changes indicated by other proxies. Lower temperatures are reconstructed from glaciated intervals (Late Ordovician, Carboniferous-Early Permian, Cenozoic) andhigher temperaturescorrespond to greenhouse intervals (Early Triassic and Middle Cretaceous). However, accurate calculation of absolute temperature is still a challenge due to the intensive dispute over constant or changing delta O-18 of the hydrosphere.
   We review and discuss the progress and remaining problems in using oxygen isotopes in deep time to understand surface and deep-water cycling. Because of the nonlinear dependence of water vapor pressure on temperature, it is generally assumed that an increase in temperature enhances the surface water cycle and precipitation. However, the exact mechanism and magnitude of the hydrological cycle response to temperature changes, as well as its spatiotemporal characteristics, are still unclear for deep time. A systematical evaluation of this relationship since the Neogene revealed that the hydrological cycle intensifies during warm climatic conditions, but the response of the hydrologic cycle to climate is not globally uniform and exhibits a marked spatial difference. This pattern is observed as well for older times, e.g., during the Carnian Humid Episode (Late Triassic), the increase in seawater temperature corresponds to a significant dry-wet transition accompanied by negative delta C-13(carb) shift and ocean anoxia, suggesting that climate warming led to the intensification of hydrological cycle and deterioration of environmental conditions, which in turn led to a decline in diversity. A similar phenomenon has been noted at the Permian-Triassic boundary. Because of the lack of suitable proxy data to monitor the deep time surface water cycle, it is still unclear whether the extreme climate changes in Phanerozoic are necessarily accompanied by drastic changes in water cycle.
   On a larger space-time scale, the Earth's water cycle involves deep processes within the Earth's interior. The water cycle from the surface to the mantle is a net inflow process; water can reduce the viscosity of asthenosphere, which is a key factor in initiating lithospheric plate tectonics. Sea level lowering caused by the continuous subduction of surface water into the mantle can contribute to continental crust rising above sea level, leading to surface denudation, and weathering, and the initiation of the terrestrial water cycle, eventually leading to a reduction in atmospheric CO2, biogeochemical cycle reorganization, and atmospheric oxidation. The deep-water cycle and its associated plate tectonic processes thus play an important role in shaping the habitability of the Earth. Oxygen is the most abundant element on Earth, and the oxygen exchange during the deep-water cycle is an effective means of tracing the interaction between the lithosphere and hydrosphere, while the oxygen isotope records from different spheres, as well as their coupled or uncoupled variation, provide important clues to the processes of matter and energy cycling between these spheres, as well as their potential causal links with major geological events at the surface, such as major oxidation events, the terrestrialization of plants, and the origin of life.

TI Spatial variations on the hydrochemistry, controls, and solute sources
   of surface water in the Weihe River Basin, China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The Weihe River Basin (WRB), the largest tributary of the Yellow River Basin (YRB), is located in the northwest of China. As the "mother river" of the Guanzhong Plain, it plays an important role in the development of Guanzhong City Group. Based on pH, electric conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), and major ionic concentrations of 227 samples collected from the main stream (MS), northern tributaries (NT), and southern tributaries (ST) of the WRB, we explored spatial differential characteristics of hydrochemistry and their controlling factors, solute sources, and water quality of surface water. The results revealed mildly alkaline pH and much higher TDS values than the global average with mean values of 7.9 and 1037.7 mg L-1, respectively. Except NO3-, the concentrations of major ions in the MS and NT were higher than those of the ST, with similar spatial distribution patterns of Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, SO42-, and Cl-. Na+ and SO42- were the most dominant cation and anion in the MS and NT controlled by both rock weathering and evaporation-crystallization processes. Ca2+ and HCO3- were the most dominant cation and anion in the ST mainly controlled by rock weathering process. Evaporite dissolution contributed the most to dissolved solutes in the MS and NT, while carbonate weathering dominated dissolved solutes in the ST. These findings were confirmed by the results of correlation matrix, principal component analysis (PCA), stoichiometric plots, and different water types identified as Na-SO4 center dot Cl in the MS and NT, and Ca-HCO3 in the ST. Atmospheric and anthropogenic inputs had a minor effect on the surface water chemistry. However, human activities could not be ignored in the ST accounting for 10.9% of the total dissolved solutes, mainly because of the fertilizer application. And the surface water of the ST was more suitable for irrigation and drinking purposes than that of the MS and NT. Knowledge of our findings could contribute new insights to the solute geochemistry and sustainable management of water resources in the lithologically distinct segments of the WRB and other similar areas.

AB Bangladesh faces a major challenge in supplying safe potable water to the most of her 160 million people. The drinking water in Bangladesh is largely sourced from hand-pump tubewells, which draw drinking water from shallow aquifer, which has been badly polluted with Arsenic in recent years. Although various methods have been proposed to solve this problem, an acceptable and sustainable solution is yet to be achieved. As an alternative, rainwater can be harvested and used to secure the safe potable water for Bangladesh. This paper proposes an alternative community-based rainwater-fed surface water supply scheme to provide fresh drinking water to the affected regions. It is argued that rainwater is a viable alternative fresh water source which can be preserved in a community owned purpose built surface water lake. A simple low-cost water treatment and distribution system can then be built to treat and supply the lake water. Various challenges for such an alternative water supply scheme are discussed in the paper.

TI Increased Antimicrobial and Multidrug Resistance Downstream of
   Wastewater Treatment Plants in an Urban Watershed
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Development and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and multidrug resistance (MDR) through propagation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) in various environments is a global emerging public health concern. The role of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) as hot spots for the dissemination of AMR and MDR has been widely pointed out by the scientific community. In this study, we collected surface water samples from sites upstream and downstream of two WWTP discharge points in an urban watershed in the Bryan-College Station (BCS), Texas area, over a period of nine months. E. coli isolates were tested for resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoperazone, gentamycin, and imipenem using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Antimicrobial resistant heterotrophic bacteria were cultured on R2A media amended with ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole for analyzing heterotrophic bacteria capable of growth on antibiotic-containing media. In addition, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method was used to measure eight ARG - tetA, tetW, aacA, ampC, mecA, ermA, blaTEM, and intI1 in the surface water collected at each time point. Significant associations (p < 0.05) were observed between the locations of sampling sites relative to WWTP discharge points and the rate of E. coli isolate resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin, cefoperazone, ciprofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole together with an increased rate of isolate MDR. The abundance of antibiotic-resistant heterotrophs was significantly greater (p < 0.05) downstream of WWTPs compared to upstream locations for all tested antibiotics. Consistent with the results from the culture-based methods, the concentrations of all ARG were substantially higher in the downstream sites compared to the upstream sites, particularly in the site immediately downstream of the WWTP effluent discharges (except mecA). In addition, the Class I integron (intI1) genes were detected in high amounts at all sites and all sampling points, and were about similar to 20 times higher in the downstream sites (2.5 x 10(7) copies/100 mL surface water) compared to the upstream sites (1.2 x 10(6) copies/100 mL surface water). Results suggest that the treated WWTP effluent discharges into surface waters can potentially contribute to the occurrence and prevalence of AMR in urban watersheds. In addition to detecting increased ARG in the downstream sites by qPCR, findings from this study also report an increase in viable AMR (HPC) and MDR (E. coli) in these sites. This data will benefit establishment of improved environmental regulations and practices to help manage AMR/MDR and ARG discharges into the environment, and to develop mitigation strategies and effective treatment of wastewater.

TI Groundwater Impacts and Management under a Drying Climate in Southern
   Australia
SO WATER
AB The trend to a hotter and drier climate, with more extended droughts, has been observed in recent decades in southern Australia and is projected to continue under climate change. This paper reviews studies on the projected impacts of climate change on groundwater and associated environmental assets in southern Australia, and describes groundwater planning frameworks and management responses. High-risk areas are spatially patchy due to highly saline groundwater or low-transmissivity aquifers. The proportional reduction in rainfall is amplified in the groundwater recharge and some groundwater discharge fluxes. This leads to issues of deteriorating groundwater-dependent ecosystems, streamflow depletion, reduced submarine discharge, groundwater inundation and intrusion in coastal regions and reduced groundwater supply for extraction. Recent water reforms in Australia support the mitigation of these impacts, but groundwater adaptation is still at its infancy. Risk management is being incorporated in regional water and groundwater management plans to support a shift to a more sustainable level of use and more climate-resilient water resources in affected areas. The emerging strategies of groundwater trade and managed aquifer recharge are described, as is the need for a national water-focused climate change planning process.

TI Effects of grazing pressure on plant species composition and water
   presence on bofedales in the Andes mountain range of Bolivia
SO MIRES AND PEAT
AB Bofedales are high-Andean peatland plant communities with high capacity for water retention, which are regarded as oases of biodiversity. These areas have great social and economic value for livestock grazing, which plays an important role in their vegetation dynamics. However, the effects of increased livestock pressure on vegetation composition and surface water have not yet been clarified. The goal of this study was to assess the impact of current grazing practices on bofedal vegetation, species diversity and function. Specifically, the study aimed to (1) quantify carrying capacity and stocking rate in grazed bofedales and (2) quantify the effects of grazing pressure on plant composition and the extents of bare soil and surface water. Biomass and stocking rate estimates for 25 bofedales along the Cordillera Real (Tropical Andes, Bolivia) showed that all bofedales were overgrazed (carrying capacity/stocking rate (CC/SR) < 1). Regression analyses showed significant decreases in number of plant species, species dominance, diversity and percent surface water as CC/SR declined (p < 0.05). Bofedales are negatively affected by increased grazing pressure and potentially affected by changes in livestock species. These pressures, combined with land use changes and climate change, could result in long-term negative effects for the ecological functioning and sustainability of bofedales.

TI Coagulation-flocculation of Microcystis aeruginosa by polymer-clay based
   composites
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Coagulation-flocculation is a critical treatment to reduce operational problems at Drinking Water Treatment Plants (DWTPs), created by episodes of cyanobacterial blooms in surface waters. There is a need for the search of good coaguflocculants that avoid release of intracellular toxins for a safer sustainable production. Clay-polymer interactions were examined for the development of efficient composites for their use as coaguflocculants for Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) suspensions. Polymers derived from poly-4-vinylpyridine (PVP) were quaternized on the pyridinic N by introducing methyl and hydroxyethyl moieties. These polymers were toxic per se; however, composites prepared either from their sorption or grafting on the clay surface of a montmorillonite exhibited null toxicity, The combination of infrared and X-ray diffraction data with thermal analysis showed a train conformation of the sorbed polymers on the clay surface whereas a brush conformation was elucidated for the grafted polymers. Only the composite prepared from grafting and subsequent quaternization with methyls was an efficient coaguflocculant, due to its high positive surface potential (+39 mV) which allowed a close contact between the quaternary moieties of the brushes and the negative cell wall. A patch flocculation mech-anism was involved, with the riks of resuspension of the coagulated cells if the composite added in excess. The optimum ratio between the amount of coagulated cyanobacteria and this composite expressed as equivalent to polymer content was 7.2 x 107 cells/mg polymer. This ratio was determined in axenic cultures of M. aeruginosa, but was reduced 5-fold in natural surface waters due to natural organic matter (NOM) content and heterogeneity. This study has demonstrated the relevance of the type of modification of the clay mineral surface with polymers to obtain good coaguflocculants of cyanobacterial cells, that can be extended to other microorganisms.

TI Influence of land use change on nitrate sources and pollutant enrichment
   in surface and groundwater of a growing urban area in Tanzania
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
AB In the present study, 3-year (1997, 2008 and 2017) satellite images as well as different hydro-chemical parameters, nitrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of nitrate were used to examine the impacts of land use and land cover change on surface and groundwater quality. Through isotopic composition, sources of surface and groundwater pollutants were also elucidated. The results showed significant land use transition whereby land use changed from forest and bare land to agricultural land and built-up areas. A slight reduction in the size of areas covered by water bodies was also observed. Results indicate differences in nitrate concentration that mirror land use changes. Samples with elevated levels of nitrate above 10 mg/L were located near agricultural fields and areas with intensive livestock keeping activities. In groundwater, ?N-15-nitrate and ?O-18-nitrate ranged from 3.2 parts per thousand to 20.1 parts per thousand with a mean value of 11.7 +/- 1.8 parts per thousand and from 2.1 parts per thousand to 12.0 parts per thousand with mean value of 5.4 +/- 1.8 parts per thousand, respectively. In surface water, ?N-15-nitrate and ?O-18-nitrate ranged from 2.4 parts per thousand to 19.3 parts per thousand with mean value of 4.9 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand and from 1.5 parts per thousand to 21.9 parts per thousand with a mean value of 13.5 +/- 2.8 parts per thousand, respectively. Isotopic composition data suggest sources of nitrate in both ground and surface water dominated by synthetic and organic fertilizer application and to a lesser extent a natural soil nitrate source.

TI Estimation of irrigation requirement for sustainable water resources
   reallocation in North China
SO AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB The South-North Water Transfer (SNWT) project (upon completion) will deliver some 4.8 billion m(3) of water per annum to Hebei, Beijing and Tianjin - greatly mitigating water shortage in North China. Surface water that is currently restricted to urban use could then become partly available for agricultural production. This will reduce the dependence of agriculture on groundwater, which will in turn retard groundwater depletion in the region. This study determines the spatial and temporal distributions of agricultural water requirement in Hebei Plain. This in turn lays the basis for surface water reallocation following the completion of the SNWT project. DSSAT and COTTON2K crop models are used along with crop coefficient methods to estimate required irrigation amounts for wheat, maize, cotton, vegetables and fruit trees in Hebei Plain. The study uses 20 years (1986-2006) of agronomic, hydrologic and climate data collected from 43 well-distributed stations across the plain. Based on the results, wheat accounts for over 40% of total irrigation water requirement in the plain. Similarly, wheat, maize and cotton together account for 64% of the total irrigation water requirement. The piedmont regions of Mount Taihang have the highest irrigation requirement due to high percent farm and irrigated land area. The months of April and May have the highest irrigation water requirement, respectively accounting for 18.1% and 25.4% of average annual irrigation. Spatial and temporal variations in our estimated irrigation water requirement are higher than those in the officially published statistics data. The higher variations in our results are more reflective of field conditions (e.g. precipitation, cropping pattern, irrigated land area, etc.). This therefore indicates a substantive improvement (in our study) over the average statistical data. Based on our simulation results, viable surface water reallocation strategies following the completion of the SNWT project are advanced and discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Non-point source fecal contamination from aging wastewater
   infrastructure is a primary driver of antibiotic resistance in surface
   waters
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Antibiotic resistance is a global threat to human health. Many surface water resources are environmental hot-spots of antibiotic resistant gene (ARG) transfer, with agricultural runoff and human waste highlighted as common sources of ARGs to aquatic systems. Here we quantified fecal marker genes and ARGs in 992 stream water samples collected seasonally during a 5-year period from 115 sites across the Upper Oconee watershed (Georgia, USA), an area characterized by gradients of agricultural and urban development. Widespread fecal contamination was found from humans (48% of samples), ruminants (55%), and poultry (19%), and 73% of samples tested positive for at least one of the six targeted ARGs (ermB, tet(B), blaCTX-M-1, blaKPC, blaSHV, and qnrS). While ARGs were strongly correlated with human fecal markers, many highly contaminated samples were not associated with sewage outfalls, an expected source of fecal and ARG pollution. To determine sources of contamination, we synthesized ARG and fecal marker data with geospatial data on land use/land cover and wastewater infrastructure across the watershed. This novel analysis found strong correlations between ARGs and measures of sewer density, sewer length, and septic system age within sample watersheds, indicating non-point sources of fecal contamination from aging wastewater infrastructure can be critical disseminators of anthropo-genic ARGs in the environment.

TI The influence of climate change on waterborne disease and Legionella: a
   review
SO PERSPECTIVES IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Climate change is predicted to have a major impact on people's lives with the recent extreme weather events and varying abnormal temperature profiles across the world raising concerns. The impacts of global warming are already being observed, from rising sea levels and melting snow and ice to changing weather patterns. Scientists state unequivocally that these trends cannot be explained by natural variability in climate alone. Human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, have warmed the earth by dramatically increasing concentrations of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere; as these concentrations increase, the more the earth will warm. Climate change and related extreme weather events are being exacerbated sooner than has previously been considered and are already adversely affecting ecosystems and human health by increasing the burden and type of disease at a local level. Changes to the marine environment and freshwater supplies already affect significant parts of the world's population and warmer temperatures, especially in more temperate regions, may see an increased spread and transmission of diseases usually associated with warmer climes including, for example, cholera and malaria; these impacts are likely to become more severe in a greater number of countries. This review discusses the impacts of climate change including changes in infectious disease transmission, patterns of waterborne diseases and the likely consequences of climate change due to warmer water, drought, higher rainfall, rising sea levels and flooding.

AB Small water bodies play a pivotal role in Sahel, as a critical source of water for livestock and people, and providers of important ecosystems services. Monitoring, modeling, and better understanding their hydrological behavior is, therefore, a key issue. The future Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission will bring a resolution and spatial coverage breakthrough, allowing the estimation of water levels and volumes in small water bodies worldwide. This paper assesses the potential of SWOT for monitoring water volumes in Sahelian ponds and lakes. This is done by analyzing SWOT-like synthetic data produced using a SWOT simulator developed by NASA-JPL. For the Agoufou lake, water levels were retrieved with an accuracy better than 4 cm, while slightly worse results were obtained for the Zalam-Zalam lake, that has a more elongated shape. In addition, data from the global precipitation mission dual-frequency precipitation radar have been also employed to investigate the backscattering coefficient variability in the same radar frequency band (Ka-band) as SWOT. We have found that, in the study region, the contrast between water and land, dependent on soil type, soil moisture, and wind conditions, is sometime quite small which can be challenging for water masks estimation. Overall, the first application of the SWOT simulator over the Sahel has shown the good potential of SWOT for monitoring the seasonal variability of water levels and volumes in this region.

TI Emerging contaminants in surface waters and their relevance for the
   production of drinking water in Europe
SO JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB An increasing part of drinking water in Europe is prepared from surface water. At the same time, a growing number of emerging contaminants is being discovered in surface water. This review provides an overview of classes of emerging contaminants nowadays detected in the aquatic environment that are of relevance for drinking water production. These comprise e. g. endocrine disrupting compounds, such as hormones and compounds with hormone-like properties, pharmaceuticals, illicit and non-controlled drugs, sweeteners, personal care products, complexing agents, nanoparticles, perfluorinated compounds, flame retardants, pesticides, and fuel additives. The individual compounds are observed in concentrations that are generally considered too low to cause acute effects. Nevertheless, health effects due to long-term exposure to a mixture of low concentrations of all kinds of emerging contaminants cannot be excluded with current knowledge. Moreover, contamination of drinking water with man-made substances is considered unwanted in principle. The precautionary principle is used to motivate that prevention of emission of emerging contaminants into the environment is the preferred approach to safeguard sustainable drinking water production. In the mean time, extensive monitoring of the sources and development and application of advanced treatment techniques are used to prepare safe drinking water.

TI Is Benin on track to reach universal household coverage of basic water,
   sanitation and hygiene services by 2030?
SO PLOS ONE
AB IntroductionWith the end of the Millennium Agenda, the United Nations Member States adopted the Sustainable Development Agenda in 2015. This new agenda identifies 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets for 2030, including Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH). ObjectiveTo study the evolution of household access to WASH services over the last two decades in Benin and make projections for 2030. MethodsIn this study, secondary analyses were performed using the datasets of the Demographic and Health Surveys in Benin from 2001 to 2017-2018. The statistical unit was the household. The achievement of the WASH SDGs targets was monitored through the proportion of households using individual basic WASH services, the proportion of households using surface water for drinking, and the proportion of households practising open defecation. The study generated Annual Percentage Changes (APCs) for outcome variables. Based on the APCs between 2001 and 2017-2018, projections were made for 2030. ResultsFrom 2001 to 2017-2018, household access to individual basic WASH services increased from 50.54% to 63.98% (APC = +1.44%), 5.39% to 13.29% (APC = +5.62%), and 2.12% to 10.11% (APC = +9.92%), respectively. At the same time, the prevalence of surface water consumption and open defecation among households decreased from 10.54% to 5.84% (APC = -3.52%) and 67.03% to 53.91% (APC = -1.31%), respectively. If the trend observed between 2001 and 2017-2018 remains unchanged, the national coverage of households with basic individual WASH services would be 76.50%, 26.33% and 10.51%, respectively, by 2030. The prevalence of surface water consumption and open defecation among households would be 3.73% and 45.71%, respectively, by 2030. ConclusionBenin achieved significant progress in household coverage of adequate WASH services over the last two decades. However, progress appears insufficient to achieve universal coverage of households with basic WASH services, and eliminate surface water consumption and open defecation by 2030. There is a need to strengthen research into the drivers of household access to adequate WASH services.

TI Basin-scale multi-objective simulation-optimization modeling for
   conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater in northwest China
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB In the arid inland basins of China, the long-term unregulated agricultural irrigation from surface water diversion and groundwater abstraction has caused the unsustainability of water resources and the degradation of ecosystems. This requires the integrated management of surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) at basin scale to achieve scientific decisions which support sustainable water resource allocation in China. This study developed a novel multi-objective simulation-optimization (S-O) modeling framework. The optimization framework integrated a new epsilon multi-objective memetic algorithm (epsilon-MOMA) with a MODFLOW-NWT model to implement real-world decision-making for water resource management while pondering the complicated groundwater-lake-river interaction in an arid inland basin. Then the optimization technique was validated through the SW-GW management in Yanqi Basin (YB), a typical arid region with intensive agricultural irrigation in northwest China. The management model, involving the maximization of total water supply rate, groundwater storage, surface runoff inflow to the terminal lake, and the minimization of water delivery cost, was proposed to explore the trade-offs between socioeconomic and environmental factors. It is shown that the trade-off surface can be achieved in the four-dimensional objective space by optimizing spatial groundwater abstraction in the irrigation districts and surface water diversion in the river. The Pareto-optimal solutions avoid the prevalence of decision bias caused by the low-dimensional optimization formulation. Decision-makers are then able to identify their desired water management schemes with preferred objectives and achieve maximal socioeconomic and ecological benefits simultaneously. Moreover, three representative runoff scenarios in relation to climate change were specified to quantify the effect of decreasing river runoff on the water management in YB. Results show that runoff depletion would have a great negative impact on the management objectives. Therefore, the integrated SW and GW management is of critical importance for the fragile ecosystem in YB under changing climatic conditions.

TI Start up of a gravity flow CANON-like MBR treating surface water under
   low temperature
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Operation conditions such as reflux, sludge retention time (SRT), aeration intermediate, hydrogen retention time (HRT) and powder active carbon (PAC) dosing were optimized to start up a CANON-like MBR. Reflux can give the MBR system a good mixture. SRT did not have much effect on washout of nitrite oxidized bacteria (NOB) but related to membrane fouling. Decreasing aeration intermediate reduced ammonium removal rate to 50% due to the limited oxygen, but nitrification was dominant. HRT did not have much influence on ammonium removal rate, whereas reduce the NO3- (produced)/NH4+ (totalremoval) value to 0.8. PAC played a great role in ammonium removal and reduced the NO3- (produced)/NH4- (totalremoval) value to 0.55. Under the optimized operation conditions such as reflux of 1 m(3)/L, SRT of 20 days, aeration intermediate of 11 h 50 min off and 10 min on, 20 mg/L of PAC, one column (8#) and a membrane reactor (9#), ammonium removal rate was increased to 99% while the NO3- (produced)/NH4+ (totalremoval) value was around 0.55. Increasing the ammonium concentration to 6 mg/L can reduce the NO3- (produced)/NH4+ (totalremoval) value to 0.13. On a whole, Dissolved oxygen (DO) is the key to start up the CANON-like MBR treating surface water even under low temperature and sustainable flux increased the sustainability of the system.

TI Living with surface water shortage and surplus: the case of sustainable
   agricultural water storage
SO AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Agricultural farmers are experiencing change in how they must manage surface water storage systems. When faced with water shortage in times of drought, there is an incentive to build up stores of water and this can be inequitable for users downstream. Furthermore, in times of water surplus in flood, the storage structures can become unsafe, with catastrophic consequences. Despite the importance of the 'dual-extreme' problem of unsustainably managed farm dams, there is also evidence of deficiencies and inconsistencies in farm dam management policy across Australia. When coupled with evidence of widespread unsustainable farm dam management practice, the way farmers respond to management pressures from regulators becomes a critical concern. The research applies Oliver's strategic response typology to a survey of 202 farmers in two states in Australia with different levels of sustainable surface water storage equity and safety policy: disconnectedness in South Australia, and interconnectedness in Tasmania. Results suggest that even in a strong, interconnected policy environment, where laws are in line with farmer goals and do not infringe on decision-making power, there may still be resistance and attempts to manipulate the regulatory pressures. Findings indicate a need to consider more flexible elements of regulation adaptable to specific settings.

AB The paper analyses firstly the condition of water-land exploitation and water-saving irrigation in Xinjiang in last 50. years. In the recent 50 years, the irrigation area has been developed from 120 X 10(4)hm(2) to 462. 69 x 10(4) hm. And the irrigation water demand increased from 160 x 10(8)m(3) to 460 X 10(8)m(3). There is 882.4 x 10(8)m(3) water of stream flow in Xinjiang. Instead of 37.8 x 10(8)m(3) water which is in high plateau and desert area, the utilizable surface water volume is 844. 6 x 10(8)m(3). In fact, it is 400 x 10(8)m(3) surface water which can supply to national economy. It is obvious that the utilizable surface water volume hadn't satisfied the need of surface water diversion of realistic diversion-water irrigation area. Therefore it is fairly severe situation of water resources utilization in Xinjiang. And so, agricultural water-saving is alternative to this problem. Taking a comprehensive view of development of agricultural irrigation in Xinjiang in last 50 years, there have surface irrigation technology and new-high water-saving technology. Through there are two kinds of irrigation technologies above-mentioned, it is difficult to realize the effect of water-saving and increasing production using the former which is engineering water-saving mode using canal anti-seepage technique. In some degree! it deprives ecological water use. The latter which is agronomic water-saving mode laying emphasis on crop growth mechanism can realize the effect of water-saving and increasing production. Buts on the other hand, it is unable to improve the soil characteristics. On the contrary, it even possible aggravates soil salinization. Therefore, both engineering water-saving and agronomic water-saving must reconsider sustainability of water-saving. Can it realize reasonable water resources allocation of the whole watershed? Can it realize sustainable utilization of water resources in the whole watershed? This paper advances a new concept of modern agricultural water-saving-sustainable water-saving which is different from real water-saving.

TI Evaluation of phosphate-uptake mechanisms by Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides in
   Early Proterozoic oceanic conditions
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY
AB Environmental contextReconstructing the Precambrian oceanic P cycle, in conjunction with the As cycle, is critical for understanding the rise of atmospheric O-2 in Earth's history. Bioavailable phosphorus (P) has been found to regulate photosynthetic activity, whereas dissolved arsenic (As) maxima correlate with photosynthetic minima. New data on empirical adsorption and coprecipitation models with Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides suggest coprecipitation is a more efficient method of P sorption than is adsorption in Precambrian surface ocean conditions. AbstractBanded iron formations (BIF) are proxies of global dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) content in Precambrian marine waters. Estimates of Precambrian DIP rely on constraining the mechanisms by which Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides scavenge DIP in NaCl solutions mimicking elevated Precambrian marine Si and Fe(II) concentrations. The two DIP binding modes suggested for Early Proterozoic marine waters are (1) surface attachment on pre-formed Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides (adsorption), and (2) incorporation of P into actively growing Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides (coprecipitation) during the oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides in the presence of DIP. It has been suggested that elevated Si concentrations, such as those suggested for Precambrian seawater, strongly inhibit adsorption of DIP in Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides; however, recent coprecipitation experiments show that DIP is scavenged by Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides in the presence of Si, seawater cations and hydrothermal As. In the present study, we show that the DIP uptake onto Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides by adsorption is less than 5 % of DIP uptake by coprecipitation. Differences in surface attachment and the possibility of structural capture within the Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides are inferred from the robust influence Si has on DIP binding during adsorption, meanwhile the influence of Si on DIP binding is inhibited during coprecipitation when As(III) and As(V) are present. In the Early Proterozoic open oceans, Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides precipitated when deep anoxic Fe(II)-rich waters rose and mixed with the first permanently oxygenated ocean surface waters. Our data imply that, DIP was removed from surface waters through coprecipitation with those Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides, rather than adsorption. Local variations in DIP and perhaps even stratification of DIP in the oceans were likely created from the continuous removal of DIP from surface waters by Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides, and by the partial release of DIP into the anoxic bottom waters and buried sediments. In addition to a DIP famine, the selectivity for DIP over As(V) may have led to As enrichment in surface waters, both of which would have most likely decreased the productivity of cyanobacteria and O-2 production.

TI Antiretroviral Drugs in African Surface Waters: Prevalence, Analysis,
   and Potential Remediation
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB The sources, ecotoxicological impact, and potential remediation strategies of antiretroviral drugs (ARVDs) as emerging contaminants in surface waters are reviewed based on recent literature. The occurrence of ARVDs in water bodies raises concern because many communities in Africa depend on rivers for water resources. Southern Africa is a potential hotspot regarding ARVD contamination due to relatively high therapeutic application and detection thereof in water bodies. Efavirenz and nevirapine are the most persistent in effluents and are prevalent in surface water based on environmental concentrations. Whereas the highest concentration of efavirenz reported in Kenya was 12.4 mu g L-1, concentrations as high as 119 and 140 mu g L-1 have been reported in Zambia and South Africa, respectively. Concentrations of ARVDs ranging from 670 to 34 000 ng L-1 (influents) and 540 to 34 000 ng L-1 (effluents) were determined in wastewater treatment plants in South Africa, compared with Europe, where reported concentrations range from less than limit of detection (LOD) to 32 ng L-1 (influents) and less than LOD to 22 ng L-1 (effluents). The present African-based review suggests the need for comprehensive toxicological and risk assessment of these emerging pollutants in Africa, with the intent of averting environmental hazards and the development of sustainable remediation strategies.

TI Pharmaceutical and Microplastic Pollution before and during the COVID-19
   Pandemic in Surface Water, Wastewater, and Groundwater
SO WATER
AB Pharmaceuticals, microplastics, and oil spills are the most hazardous contaminants in aquatic environments. The COVID-19 pandemic enhanced pharmaceutical and microplastic contamination in aquatic environments. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of pharmaceutical and microplastic pollution on a global scale. This study assessed the results of pharmaceutical contamination in 25 countries and microplastic pollution in 13 countries. The findings show that pharmaceutical residues were detected in surface water, groundwater, and wastewater influents and effluents. In total, 43 types of pharmaceutical products were detected in 25 countries. Caffeine, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, sulfamethoxazole, and carbamazepine were the most abundant. In total, 32 types of polymers were detected in 13 countries. In the case of microplastics, polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate were the more abundant polymers. Particles with a size of 1-2.5 mm and 2.5-5 mm accounted for half of the microplastics present in 13 countries. This study provides new evidence of the importance of emerging pollutants in aquatic environments before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI Hydrologic characteristics of a small tropical riverine wetland at
   Ulakwo, Imo State, Nigeria
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB The hydrologic and water-quality characteristics of a small tropical riverine wetland at Ulakwo, near Owerri, Imo State, Nigeria, were evaluated by analysis of stream hydrographs, the groundwater flow system, and geochemical analyses. This research is an initial step toward providing information needed to develop a programme of sustainable development of the ecosystem. The wetland is underlain by a layer of organic debris and hydromorphic soils, which in turn are underlain by an unconfined alluvial sand aquifer about 80 m thick. Horizontal and upward vertical hydraulic head gradients of about 0.002 and 0.001, respectively, and the results of a flow-net analysis suggest that considerable amounts of groundwater flow into the wetland.
   Low concentrations of Fe, NO3, PO4, and SO4 in the wetland water column are probably due to shortterm removal of these nutrients from the surface-water by adsorption on the surficial wetland organic matter and bottom sediments. The groundwater flow system is important in the maintenance of the wetland, which probably plays an important role in the flow stabilisation and improvement of the water quality of the river.

For this purpose, methods of statistical variability analysis, calculation of aridity index based on the UNEP classification and discontinuity detection on rainfall and flow series were used over the period 1961-2010. The water deficit index, the base flow index and the seasonal irregularity index were calculated. This study revealed that since 1975 the Volta basin in Benin has experienced a drought persistence leading to an increased climate aridity (20% from 1961 to 2010). Rainfall decreased by 13% while the aridity index varies from 0.01 to 2.66, indicating dry sub-humid climate to hyperarid climate at the monthly scale. Indeed, annual variation in flow decreased by 41% in the sub-basin of Porga and 32% in that of Tiele over the period 1975-2010 compared with 1961-1975. Also, an increased base flow index of 0.6 to 0.8% at Porga, 0 to 0.1% at Tiele supported by very marked seasonal irregularity were relevant indicators of hydrological drought and surface water scarcity. The sensitivity of the hydrological regimes to the change of aridity in the Volta basin should be a basis for sustainable water management strategies development in the Sudano-Sahelian area of Africa.

TI Sources, fate and transport of perfluorocarboxylates
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB This review describes the sources, fate, and transport of perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs) in the environment, with a specific focus on perfluorooctanoate (PFO). The global historical industry-wide emissions of total PFCAs from direct (manufacture, use, consumer products) and indirect (PFCA impurities and/or precursors) sources were estimated to be 3200-7300 tonnes. It was estimated that the majority (similar to 80%) of PFCAs have been released to the environment from fluoropolymer manufacture and use. Although indirect sources were estimated to be much less important than direct sources,there were larger uncertainties associated with the calculations for indirect sources. The physical-chemical properties of PFO (negligible vapor pressure, high solubility in water, and moderate sorption to solids) suggested that PFO would accumulate in surface waters. Estimated mass inventories of PFO in various environmental compartments confirmed that surface waters, especially oceans, contain the majority of PFO. The only environmental sinks for PFO were identified to be sediment burial and transport to the deep oceans, implying a long environmental residence time. Transport pathways for PFCAs in the environment were reviewed, and it was concluded that, in addition to atmospheric transport/degradation of precursors, atmospheric and ocean water transport of the PFCAs themselves could significantly contribute to their long-range transport. It was estimated that 2-12 tonnes/ year of PFO are transported to the Artic by oceanic transport, which is greater than the amount estimated to result from atmospheric transport/degradation of precursors.

TI Towards a global interpretation of dual nitrate isotopes in surface
   waters
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X
AB Modern anthropogenic activities have significantly increased nitrate (NO3-) concentrations in surface waters. Stable isotopes (delta N-15 and delta O-18) in NO3- offer a tool to deconvolute some of the human-made changes in the nitrogen cycle. They are often graphically illustrated on a template designed to identify different sources of NO3- and denitrification. In the two decades since this template was developed, delta N-1(5)- and delta O-1(8)-NO3- have been measured in a variety of ecosystems and through the nitrogen cycle. However, its interpretation is often fuzzy or complex. This default is no longer helpful because it does not describe surface water ecosystems well and biases researchers towards denitrification as the NO3- removal pathway, even in well oxygenated systems where denitrification is likely to have little to no influence on the nitrogen cycle. We propose a different scheme to encourage a better understanding of the nitrogen cycle and interpretation of NO3- isotopes. We use a mechanistic understanding of NO3- formation to place bounds on the oxygen isotope axis and provide a means to adjust for different environmental water isotope values, so data from multiple sites and times of year can be appropriately compared. We demonstrate that any interpretation of our example datasets (Canada, Kenya, United Kingdom) show clear evidence of denitrification or a mixture of NO3- sources simply because many data points fall outside of arbitrary boxes which cannot be supported once the range of potential delta O-1(8)-NO(3)(- )values has been considered.

TI The potential impacts of global climate change on marine protected areas
SO REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES
AB The potential effects of global climate change on marine protected areas do not appear to have been addressed in the literature. This paper examines the literature on protected areas, conservation biology, marine ecology, oceanography, and climate change, and reviews some of the relevant differences between marine and terrestrial environments. Frameworks and classifications systems used in protected area design are discussed. Finally, a framework that summarizes some of the important oceanographic processes and their links to the food chain are reviewed. Species abundance and distribution are expected to change as a result of global climate change, potentially compromising the efficacy of marine protected areas as biodiversity conservation tools. This review suggests the need for: further interdisciplinary research and the use of linked models; an increase in marine protected areas for biodiversity conservation and as research sites for teasing apart fishing effects from climate effects; a temporally responsive approach to siting new marine protected areas, shifting their locations if necessary; and large-scale ecosystem/integrated management approaches to address the competing uses of the oceans and boundary-less threats such as global climate change and pollution.

TI Climate Change Impacts on Agricultural Water Availability in the Middle
   Rio Grande Basin
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
AB We present a comprehensive analysis of water availability under plausible future climate conditions in a heavily irrigated agricultural watershed located in the middle section of the Rio Grande Basin in the United States Desert Southwest. Future managed streamflow scenarios (through year 2099) were selected from among 97 scenarios developed based on downscaled, bias-corrected global climate model outputs to evaluate future inflows to the principal surface water storage reservoirs, possible future reservoir releases, and groundwater pumping to sustain irrigated agriculture. The streamflow projections describe a wide range of dry and wet conditions compared to the average historical flows in the river, indicating significant uncertainty in future water availability in the Rio Grande Basin. We applied the Soil and Water Assessment Tool to illustrate the impact of climate futures on different components of the water budget at a watershed scale. Results indicate declining reliability of reservoir storage to meet the water demand of irrigated agriculture. The impact of declining surface water can be offset by increasing the pressure on the already-strained groundwater resources. However, the region should be prepared to use slightly saline (total dissolved solids [TDS] > 1,000 mg/L) and moderately saline groundwater (TDS > 3,000 mg/L) as fresh groundwater in the regional aquifer is depleted within the 21st Century under hotter and drier conditions and status quo agricultural land and water management practices.

TI Groundwater conceptualization and modeling using distributed SWAT-based
   recharge for the semi-arid agricultural Neishaboor plain, Iran
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Increased irrigation in the Neishaboor watershed, Iran, during the last few decades has caused serious groundwater depletion, making the development of comprehensive mitigation strategies and tools increasingly important. In this study, SWAT and MODFLOW were employed to integratively simulate surface-water and groundwater flows. SWAT and MODFLOW were iteratively executed to compute spatial and temporal distributions of hydrologic components. The combined SWAT-MODFLOW model was calibrated (2000-2010) and validated (2010-2012) based on streamflow, wheat yield, groundwater extraction, and groundwater-level data. This multi-criteria calibration procedure provided greater confidence for the partitioning of water between soil storage, actual evapotranspiration, and aquifer recharge. The SWAT model provided satisfactory predictions of the hydrologic budget for the watershed outlet. It also provided good predictions of irrigated wheat yield and groundwater extraction. The 10-year mean annual recharge rate estimated using the combined model varied greatly, ranging from 0 to 960 mm, with an average of 176 mm. This result showed good agreement with the independently estimated annual recharge rate from an earlier study. The combined model provides a robust tool for the sustainable planning and management of water resources for areas with stressed aquifers where interaction between groundwater and surface water cannot be easily assessed.

TI WATER RETENTION MEASURES - CASE STUDY FROM SLOVAKIA
SO WATER STUDIES
AB Water retention measures are multi-functional measures that aim to protect water resources using natural means and processes. These measures can contribute to reducing the risk of floods and water scarcity and drought while also improving the status of surface and ground water bodies. Water retention measures can support the achievement of the goals of a range of EU policies, including those for surface water, groundwater and coastal management, nature conservation, agriculture, forestry, urban water management, disaster risk management, green growth and climate change mitigation and adaptation. This article presents water retention measures suitable for application in urban areas. Infiltration of rainwater, taking into account the suitability of local conditions, appears to be the most environmentally suitable solution of rainwater drainage. The connection of conventional method of draining rainwater through sewer systems and infiltration of rainwater appears to be the most suitable drainage concept for sustainable cities.

TI The Ocean Carbon Cycle in the Western Arctic Ocean DISTRIBUTIONS AND
   AIR-SEA FLUXES OF CARBON DIOXIDE
SO OCEANOGRAPHY
AB The Arctic Ocean is a potentially important sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) With a recent estimate suggesting that the region Contributes from 5 to 14% of the global ocean's net uptake of CO2. In the western Arctic, Ocean, the focus of this paper the Chukchir Sea is a Ocean sink for CO2 compensated for by outgassing of CO2 from the East Siberian Sea shelf. The Arctic marine carbon cycle and exchange of CO2 between the ocean and atmosphere appear particularly sensitive to environmental changes, including sea ice loss, warming, changes in seasonal marine phytoplankton primary production, changes in ocean circulation and freshwater inputs, and even the impacts of ocean acidification. In the near term, further sea ice loss, increases in phytoplankton growth rates, and other environmental and physical changes in the Arctic are expected to cause a limited net increase in the uptake of CO2 by Arctic surface waters. Recent studies suggest that this enhanced uptake will be short lived, with surface waters rapidly warming and equilibrating with the atmosphere. Furthermore, release of large stores of carbon from the surrounding Arctic landmasses through rivers into the Arctic Ocean and further warming over the next century may alter the Arctic from a CO2 sink to a source over the next century.

TI Diversity and Sources of Airborne Eukaryotic Communities (AEC) in the
   Global Dust Belt over the Red Sea
SO EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Airborne eukaryotic communities (AEC), rank among the least studied aerobiological components, despite their adverse impacts on human health and the environment. Here, we describe the AECs in the global dust belt, the area between the west coast of North Africa and Central Asia, which supports the highest dust fluxes on the planet. We sampled atmospheric dust over 14 months (fall 2015-fall 2016) from onshore and offshore locations of the Red Sea, the only waterbody that entirely encompassed in the global dust belt. We also sampled surface water samples to determine the potential transfer of taxa across the air-sea interface. To target the eukaryotes, we performed Miseq sequencing of atmospheric dust and surface water samples. Analysis of amplicon sequencing indicates a total pool of 18,816 sequence variants (SVs). Among 33 unique eukaryotic phyla in the AEC over the Red Sea, the most dominant taxa were Streptophyta, Apicomplexa, and Ascomycota. Aerosol eukaryotes originated from various sources and formed more diverse communities than eukaryotic communities of the Red Sea surface water. AECs were dominated by phylotypes released from plant material and soils, and including taxa reported to be harmful to human health. The AEC composition was significantly influenced by sampling locations and seasonal conditions but not by the origin of the air masses nor dust loads. This work is original and uses state-of-the-art methods and very powerful NGS- bioinformatics and statistical approaches. The selected study site has high interest and it has been well chosen because of the unique combination of high loads of dust deposition, being the only fully contained seawater body in the area acting as a sink for the atmospheric dust, and the lack of riverine inputs and watershed effects empathizing the role of atmospheric inputs in the ecology of the system.

TI Epidemiological significance of the occurrence and persistence of
   rotaviruses in water and sewage: a critical review and proposal for
   routine microbiological monitoring
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS
AB Globally, waterborne gastroenteritis attributable to rotaviruses is on the increase due to the rapid increase in population growth, poor socioeconomic conditions, and drastic changes in climatic conditions. The burden of diarrhea is quite alarming in developing nations where the majority of the populations still rely on untreated surface water that is usually polluted for their immediate water needs. Humans and animals of all ages are affected by rotaviruses. In humans, the preponderance of cases occurs in children under 5 years. Global efforts in advancing water/wastewater treatment technologies have not yet realized the objective of complete viral removal from wastewater. Most times, surface waters are impacted heavily by inadequately treated wastewater run-offs thereby exposing people or animals to preventable health risks. The relative stability of rotaviruses in aquatic matrices during wastewater treatment, poor correlation of bacteriological indicators with the presence of rotaviruses, and their infectiousness at a low dose informed the proposal for inclusion in the routine microbiological water screening panel. Environmental monitoring data have been shown to provide early warnings that can complement clinical data used to monitor the impact of current rotavirus vaccination in a community. This review was therefore undertaken to critically appraise rotavirus excretion and emission pathways, and the existence, viability and persistence in the receiving aquatic milieu. The efficiency of the current wastewater treatment modality for rotavirus removal, correlation of the current bacteriological water quality assessment strategy, public health risks and current laboratory methods for an epidemiological study were also discussed.

TI Quantification of microbial risks to human health caused by waterborne
   viruses and bacteria in an urban slum
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
AB Aims To determine the magnitude of microbial risks from waterborne viruses and bacteria in Bwaise III in Kampala (Uganda), a typical slum in Sub-Saharan Africa.
   Methods and Results A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) was carried out to determine the magnitude of microbial risks from waterborne pathogens through various exposure pathways in Bwaise III in Kampala (Uganda). This was based on the concentration of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., rotavirus (RV) and human adenoviruses F and G (HAdV) in spring water, tap water, surface water, grey water and contaminated soil samples. The total disease burden was 680 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 1000 persons per year. The highest disease burden contribution was caused by exposure to surface water open drainage channels (39%) followed by exposure to grey water in tertiary drains (24%), storage containers (22%), unprotected springs (8%), contaminated soil (7%) and tap water (002%). The highest percentage of the mean estimated infections was caused by E.coli O157:H7 (41%) followed by HAdV (32%), RV (20%) and Salmonella spp. (7%). In addition, the highest infection risk was 1 caused by HAdV in surface water at the slum outlet, while the lowest infection risk was 271x10(-6) caused by E.coli O157:H7 in tap water.
   Conclusions The results show that the slum environment is polluted, and the disease burden from each of the exposure routes in Bwaise III slum, with the exception of tap water, was much higher than the WHO reference level of tolerable risk of 1x10(-6) DALYs per person per year.
   Significance and Impact of the Study The findings of this study provide guidance to governments, local authorities and nongovernment organizations in making decisions on measures to reduce infection risk and the disease burden by 10(2) to 10(5) depending on the source of exposure to achieve the desired health impacts. The infection risk may be reduced by sustainable management of human excreta and grey water, coupled with risk communication during hygiene awareness campaigns at household and community level. The data also provide a basis to make strategic investments to improve sanitary conditions in urban slums.

TI Spatial distribution, receptor modelling and risk assessment of
   organophosphate esters in surface water from the largest freshwater lake
   in China
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB The occurrence and risk of organophosphate esters (OPEs) has become a global concern in recent years. This study investigated the occurrence, spatial distribution, and potential sources of thirteen OPEs and their associated ecological and human health risks in water samples from the largest freshwater lake, Poyang Lake, together with its five major inflow rivers and the water channel to Yangtze River. The total OPEs concentrations ranged from 38.44 ng/L to 428.94 ng/L, and the largest tributary Ganjiang River was much more polluted than other rivers. Chlorinated OPEs, such as tris (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate and tri (2-chloroethyl) phosphate occupied the dominant composition of OPEs in the research area. Principal component analysis with multiple linear regression, positive matrix factorization, and correlation analysis were used to apportion the potential sources of OPEs in surface water. The combined contribution of polyvinyl chloride, polyester resins, and polyurethane foam (68.64%), antifoam agent and hydraulic fluids (21.50%), and the release of decorative materials and electric equipment from indoor (9.86%) were identified as the OPEs sources in the study region. The risk quotients (RQs) showed the ecological risk was negligible, but 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate exposures posed medium ecological risk to aquatic organisms. The carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks of the target OPEs were below the theoretical risk threshold values, however, toddlers were much more sensitive to the OPEs exposure in surface water than teenagers and adults. Oral ingestion was the principal exposure pathway, and the health risk via oral ingestion was 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than dermal contact exposure route.

TI Comprehensive Evaluation of Water Resource Characteristics in the
   Northern Yangtze River Delta, China
SO WATER
AB The Yangtze River Delta is one of the most economically developed regions on the eastern coast of China. However, a local imbalance currently exists between its water resource environment and economic and social development due to its rapid urbanization. Thus, the reasonable evaluation and protection of local water resources are necessary. This study explores the northern Yangtze Delta, which is a more developed water system, as a pilot area. The temporal and spatial variation characteristics of rainfall and evaporation and their influencing factors were analyzed on the basis of 29 surface water sampling points, 16 rainfall stations, and three evaporation stations in the field from 1956 to 2019. Accordingly, the overall water supply quality of the river basin, the availability of different water resources, and the application of evaluation methods were assessed. Results show that local precipitation and evaporation are characterized by uneven spatial and temporal distributions in local areas, which, in turn, leads to the uneven temporal distribution of runoff, increasing the imbalance between the availability and demand of the limited local water resources. Nevertheless, the overall performance of local water quality is good. Surface water quality is mostly II to III, and locally IV. Most noncompliant months are during the non-flood season, and all values exceed the standard permanganate index. Groundwater is Class III or better, and the hydrochemistry type is predominantly calcium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, and magnesium bicarbonate. By exploring the evaluation model of the Yangtze River Delta watershed characteristics, this study aims to provide a helpful reference for extending water resource evaluation in the Yangtze River Delta. Accordingly, this study can promote the sustainable development of the economic and social sectors of the Yangtze River Delta and the construction of its ecological environment.

TI Rapid quantitative analysis of microcystins in raw surface waters with
   MALDI MS utilizing easily synthesized internal standards
SO TOXICON
AB The freshwater cyanotoxins, microcystins (MCs), pose a global public health threat as potent hepatotoxins in cyanobacterial blooms; their persistence in drinking and recreational water has been associated with potential chronic effects in addition to acute intoxications. Rapid and accurate detection of the over 80 structural congeners is challenged by the rigorous and time consuming clean up required to overcome interference found in raw water samples. MALDI-MS has shown promise for rapid quantification of individual congeners in raw water samples, with very low operative cost, but so far limited sensitivity and lack of available and versatile internal standards (ISs) has limited its use. Two easily synthesized S-hydroxyethyl-Cys(7)-MC-LR and -RR ISs were used to generate linear standard curves in a reflectron MALDI instrument, reproducible across several orders of magnitude for MC-LR, -RR and -YR. Minimum quantification limits in direct water samples with no clean up or concentration step involved were consistently below 7 mu g/L, with recoveries from spiked samples between 80 and 119%. This method improves sensitivity by 30 fold over previous reports of quantitative MALDI-TOF applications to MCs and provides a salient option for rapid throughput analysis for multiple MC congeners in untreated raw surface water blooms as a means to identify source public health threats and target intervention strategies within a watershed. As demonstrated by analysis of a set of samples from Uruguay, utilizing the reaction of different MC congeners with alternate sulfhydryl compounds, the m/z of the IS can be customized to avoid overlap with interfering compounds in local surface water samples.

TI Occurrence and Detection Problems of Micro- and Nanoplastics in the
   Water Environment of Russia
SO MOSCOW UNIVERSITY GEOLOGY BULLETIN
AB Numerous studies on plastic pollution of natural environment have been published. Special attention is paid to micro- (<5 mm) and nano-sized (<100 nm) plastic particles (MP and NP, respectively). The particles are found universally: in waters and bottom sediments of the World Ocean in rivers, lakes and groundwater, beach sediments, and even in Arctic and Antarctic snow and ice, in foodstuff and bottled water, as well as in living organisms at all stages of the food chain. Environmental pollution with plastic has already become as global a problem as climate change. This review analyzes and summarizes the current publications on the problems of MP and NP contamination in natural waters, mainly over the territory of the Russian Federation. A schematic map of MP occurrence in surface waters of Russia has been plotted for the first time. A summary table is presented on MP concentrations in surface water and groundwater, bottled mineral and tap water, as well as in bottom sediments of the world rivers, seas and oceans. It is clearly shown that there is a shortage of studies of MP and NP contamination in groundwater, although their content is also quite high. The problem of measuring the MP and NP concentrations, along with determining their composition, is described and the features, advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of all the main detection methods are considered. Generalized schemes of water and soil sampling and preparation for MP determination are presented. It is concluded that no optimum procedure is available and only the integration of techniques allows one to identify MP and NP contamination in the best way.

TI California groundwater management, science-policy interfaces, and the
   legacies of artificial legal distinctions
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB California water law has traditionally treated groundwater and surface water as separate resources. The 2014 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) broke with this tradition by requiring groundwater managers to avoid significant and unreasonable adverse impacts to beneficial uses of surface water. This paper considers the trajectory of this partial integration of science, law, and resource management policy. Drawing on legal analysis and participatory workshops with subject area experts, we describe the challenges of reconciling the separate legal systems that grew out of an artificial legal distinction between different aspects of the same resource. Our analysis offers two main contributions. First, it demonstrates that laws that subdivide an interconnected resource can have legacy effects that linger long after lawmakers begin dismantling the artificial divides. Using SGMA as a case study, the article illustrates the complexities of reconciling law with science, showing that reconciliation is a process that does not end with updating statutes, or with any other single intervention. Second, we introduce a framework for evaluating the elements of an effort to reconcile law with scientific understanding, whether that reform effort involves groundwater or some other resource. Applying that framework helps reveal where lingering legacy effects still need to be addressed. More generally, it reveals the need for literature addressing science-policy interactions to devote more attention to the multifaceted nature of law and policy reform. Much of that literature describes policy-making in broad and undifferentiated terms, often referring simply to the science-policy interface.' But as the SGMA case study illustrates, the complex and multi-layered nature of policy-making means that a successful reform effort may need to address many science-policy interfaces.

TI Occurrence of pharmaceutical compounds in urban wastewater: Removal,
   mass load and environmental risk after a secondary treatment-A review
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB This review focuses on 118 pharmaceuticals, belonging to seventeen different therapeutic classes, detected in raw urban wastewater and effluent from an activated sludge system, a usual treatment adopted for urban wastewaters worldwide prior to final discharge into surface water bodies. Data pertaining to 244 conventional activated sludge systems and 20 membrane biological reactors are analysed and the observed ranges of variability of each selected compound in their influent and effluent reported, with particular reference to the substances detected most frequently and in higher concentrations. A snapshot of the ability of these systems to remove such compounds is provided by comparing their global removal efficiencies for each substance. Where possible, the study then evaluates the average daily mass load of the majority of detected pharmaceuticals exiting the secondary treatment step. The final part of the review provides an assessment of the environmental risk posed by their presence in the secondary effluent by means of the risk quotient that is the ratio between the average pharmaceutical concentration measured in the secondary effluent and the predicted no-effect concentration.
   Finally, mass load rankings of the compounds under review are compared with those based on their risk level. This analysis shows that the highest amounts discharged through secondary effluent pertain to one antihypertensive, and several beta-blockers and analgesics/anti-inflammatories, while the highest risk is posed by antibiotics and several psychiatric drugs and analgesics/anti-inflammatories. These results are reported with a view to aiding scientists and administrators in planning measures aiming to reduce the impact of treated urban wastewater discharge into surface water bodies.

TI Assessing the Water-Resources Potential and Soil Erosion Hotspot Areas
   for Sustainable Land Management in the Gidabo Watershed, Rift Valley
   Lake Basin of Ethiopia
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB For development of a comprehensive sediment management plan, it is crucial to categorize watersheds on the basis of soil erosion hotspot areas to extend the useful life of water bodies (e.g., Gidam reservoir). The goal of this study was to assess the surface water potential and identify erosion hotspot areas of the Gidabo watershed in Ethiopia using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The SUFI-2 (Sequential Uncertainty Fitting Version 2) program was used to calibrate the model, and the model's performance was evaluated. According to the catchment prioritization analysis, some of the sub-basins with similar land use, land cover, and soil type but with higher slope would generate higher sediment yield. Furthermore, the soil conservation scenarios were developed in SWAT, and the model result showed that average annual sediment yield could be reduced by the application of grassed waterway, filter strips, terracing, and contouring by 49%, 37.53%, 62.32%, and 54.6% respectively. It was concluded that sediment yield reduction by applying terracing was more effective than other conservation measures for affected sub-basins. The surface water potential of the watershed varies spatially from sub-basin to sub-basin, and the mean monthly surface water potential of the watershed is 33 million cubic meters. These findings can help decision-makers to develop appropriate strategies to minimize the erosion rate from erosion hotspot areas and to allocate the watershed water potential for different types of water demands. Strip planting, terracing, or contour farming may be necessary on chosen hotspot erosion sites to reduce the effect of slopes on surface runoff flow velocity and sediment transport capacity.

AB Water is essential for life on Earth. Surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) are the main sources for drinking water supply and important resources also for industry and agriculture. These two components of the hydrological cycle are interconnected and affecting each other, as well as the natural environment. During SW-GW interaction the water quality and quantity can change considerably. The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) addressed the need of a sustainable management of coupled GW-SW resources and their ecosystems. The WFD recommends estimating the exchange flow rates and flow directions between SW and GW. This requires an enhanced knowledge of these systems. The exchange of water, solutes and colloids between SW and GW, or the hyporheic exchange, perform through the hyporheic zone. The stream hydrology and morphology significantly influence the spatial patterns of this exchange. Moreover stream-aquifer interactions are also influenced by riverbed clogging processes. The infiltration or drainage resistance of rivers influence the duration of hyporheic exchange. The value of these two parameters primarily depends on the clogging processes and the thickness of riverbed sediments. In this study, the interaction between GW and SW and the dynamics of flow processes in the GW-SW system was modelled for different infiltration and drainage resistance parameters. The model area is situated on the Rye Island, which is a lowland area with very low slope. In this area a channel network was built up, which serves for drainage. Because of the low slope and the system of water gates built on the channels, the riverbeds are influenced by intensive clogging processes. The objective of this study was to measure the thickness of riverbed sediments and to model their influence on the GW-SW interaction in the study area. The groundwater heads and the groundwater flow direction were simulated for different infiltration/drainage resistance parameters of the rivers.

TI Distribution and ecological risk assessment of typical antibiotics in
   the surface waters of seven major rivers, China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS
AB The consumption and production of antibiotics in China rank highest in the world. As such, the occurrence of antibiotics in environmental media of China has raised significant concerns. Rivers play an important role in the sustainable development of China's economy and society, possibly causing high levels and detection frequencies of antibiotics in the aquatic environment of rivers in China. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the distribution and risk level of antibiotics in rivers. From south to north, China has seven major rivers vertically and horizontally. They are Yangtze River, Yellow River, Hai River, Liao River, Huai River, Songhua River and Pearl River. In this review, we made an extensive literature survey and published all studies on antibiotic concentrations in seven river systems of China from 2010 to 2020 were sorted out to provide a clear draw of the distribution characteristics of antibiotics. We found that 70 antibiotics have been detected in the seven major river systems. 13 typical antibiotics in surface waters of seven river systems were systematically reviewed and ecological risk assessment was conducted. The occurrence frequencies of high-risk antibiotics in surface waters followed the rank order: ETM-H2O > CIP > OFX > SMX > NOR. The RQ(s) values of seven rivers decreased in the order of Hai River (1.58-18 094.3) > Liao River (1.14-290.23) > Pearl River (2.11-118.25) > Yangtze River (0.3-64.78) > Yellow River (7.56-35.45) > Songhua River (0.03-22.26) > Huai River (1.87-20.83).

TI Effectiveness of water protection policy in China: A case study of
   Jiaxing
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The rapid economic growth in China has caused ever-increasing pollution and gradual deterioration of surface water quality over the whole territory of China since 1978. Along with it, there have been 130 environmental protection policies publicized and enacted. Unfortunately, even though these contradictory phenomena have coexisted for almost three decades,the cause analysis and the effective evaluation of policy measures are still rare. The Jiaxing region, a lowland located at the Taihu Lake watershed, is a typical representative of this dilemma and was proposed as a case study area for an assessment on the effectiveness of the environmental policy measures mentioned above. The pollutant loads originating from point pollution sources were discharged into rivers at fixed in-stream sites, while pollutant loads from non-point pollution sources in rural areas were assumed to be rushed into rivers by stormwater runoff. The environmental policy measures concerning water quality in the Jiaxing region were specified quantitatively as parameters for estimating the variation of pollutant loads. The base case and other three cases with the effects of policy measures were then simulated by the surface water quality models. The results show that a significant improvement of the surface water quality can be achieved by controlling the non-point pollution in rural areas and the point pollution over the whole area, if the water protection policies are sustainable and executed completely, and if the local government is active in their administrative, supervising and educational responsibilities and the farmers assume voluntary activities on rural pollution control.

TI Imidacloprid: Comparative toxicity, DNA damage, ROS production and risk
   assessment for aquatic non-target organisms
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Imidacloprid is a neonicotinoid systemic insecticide used worldwide. Despite its hazardous impact on non-target organisms, few studies have been conducted concerning the potential eco-genotoxic effects in invertebrates of surface waters where this pesticide is detected from units of ng/L to tens of mu g/L. The aim of the present work was to determine the acute, the sub-chronic and the chronic toxicity of imidacloprid in producers and primary consumers of the freshwater trophic chain. The organisms under investigation were the green alga Raphidocelis subcapitata, the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, the cladoceran crustacean Ceriodaphnia dubia and the benthic ostracod Heterocypris incongruens. In addition, potential DNA damage and ROS production were evaluated in C. dubia.Furthermore, in accordance with European guidelines, toxicological risk assessment of imidacloprid was performed for all continents considering its global occurrence in surface waters. In addition, we assessed the genotoxicological risk and median inhibition of reproduction was observed at units of mg/L for rotifers and daphnids. Algae showed the lowest level of sensitivity to the pesticide with effective concentrations from units to hundreds of mg/L. DNA lesions were marked from 7 mu g/L with a significant increase in damage as concentrations increased. Chronic toxicity risk quotient values were generally below to a threshold value of 1, with no conse-quential environmental concern other than for the Canadian areas. On the contrary, the genotoxicological risk quotient values were found higher than the threshold value in all continents.

TI Spatiotemporal characteristics of surface water resources in the Tibetan
   plateau: Based on the produce water coefficient method considering
   snowmelt
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The Tibetan Plateau (TP), with its widely distributed cryosphere elements and the source of 12 major rivers, is a stra-tegic area for Asian water resource generation, storage, and migration. Because of the unique surface water resources (SWR) characteristics, multi-phase and multiple sources, the hydrological process here is extremely complex. Coupled with the lack of measured data, the SWR in the TP has not been quantified refinedly. Thus, an improved large-scale SWR assessment method was proposed based on the produce water coefficient (PWC) method considering snowmelt. It overcomes the challenge of scarcity of data on ungauged regions. As climate changes, long-sequence dynamic eval-uation of SWR can be achieved refinedly. As a result, the datasets of the amount of SWR of the level 4 water resources zones (WRZ) in the TP from 1956 to 2018 were obtained by calculating the PWC and snowmelt. Then spatiotemporal characteristics of SWR in the TP were analyzed. The results showed that the annual average SWR of the TP has been increasing over the past 60 years. Affected by climate change, the SWR in the Eastern TP increased, while the SWR in the Western TP (western part of the Karakoram Mountains) decreased significantly. The findings could be beneficial for water resource security and sustainable development in Asia. This revised method, which well avoided the mises-timation of classical methods, could be used to evaluate the large-scale SWR for cold and ungauged regions.

TI Impaired Water Hazard Zones: Mapping Intersecting Environmental Health
   Vulnerabilities and Polluter Disproportionality
SO ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB This study advanced a rigorous spatial analysis of surface water-related environmental health vulnerabilities in the California Bay-Delta region, USA, from 2000 to 2006. It constructed a novel hazard indicator-"impaired water hazard zones"-from regulatory estimates of extensive non-point-source (NPS) and point-source surface water pollution, per section 303(d) of the U.S. Clean Water Act. Bivariate and global logistic regression (GLR) analyses examined how established predictors of surface water health-hazard exposure vulnerability explain census block groups' proximity to impaired water hazard zones in the Bay-Delta. GLR results indicate the spatial concentration of Black disadvantage, isolated Latinx disadvantage, low median housing values, proximate industrial water pollution levels, and proximity to the Chevron oil refinery-a disproportionate, "super emitter", in the Bay-Delta-significantly predicted block group proximity to impaired water hazard zones. A geographically weighted logistic regression (GWLR) specification improved model fit and uncovered spatial heterogeneity in the predictors of block group proximity to impaired water hazard zones. The modal GWLR results in Oakland, California, show how major polluters beyond the Chevron refinery impair the local environment, and how isolated Latinx disadvantage was the lone positively significant population vulnerability factor. The article concludes with a discussion of its scholarly and practical implications.

TI Application of multi-method approach to assess groundwater-surface water
   interactions, for catchment management
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Globally, the dependence of river systems to delayed discharge of subsurface water to augment flows during dry seasons is well documented. Discharge of fresh subsurface water can dilute concentrated river flow quality during reduced flow. Observed and reported results on the Berg River's declining water quantity and quality are a concern to the regions socio-economic growth and environmental integrity. Understanding the role of subsurface water discharges on the quantity and quality of receiving surface water courses can improve their management during dry periods. A case study was designed and implemented in the upper Berg River catchment in the Western Cape Province of South Africa to assess the influence of groundwater-surface water interaction on water quantity and quality. This study aimed to quantify and characterize the quality of subsurface water available in the upper catchment to improve observed declining water quality downstream. Hydrograph separation provided estimates of water fluxes during 2012-2014 low and high flow periods, while hydrochemical analysis provided insights on impacts of major land use activity in this catchment on water resources. Hydrograph separation analysis indicated that the Berg River is 37.9% dependent on subsurface water discharges annually. Dominant Na-Cl-type water indicates the quality of water from the upper Berg River is largely affected by natural processes including short residence times of aquifer water, rock-water interactions and atmospheric deposition of NaCl ions. These results provide insights for suggesting management options to be implemented to protect subsurface water for continued dilution and water resources management in the lower catchments.

TI Modeling the spatio-temporal flow dynamics of groundwater-surface water
   interactions of the Lake Tana Basin, Upper Blue Nile, Ethiopia
SO HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
AB The Ethiopian government has selected Lake Tana basin as a development corridor due to its water resources potential. However, combined use of groundwater (GW) and surface water (SW) is still inadequate due to knowledge gaps about the flow dynamics of GW and SW. Mostly, there is no information about groundwater use. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the dynamics of GW-SW interactions on a spatio-temporal basis in three of the main catchments (Gilgelabay, Gumara and Ribb) that drain into Lake Tana. To this end, the SWAT-MODFLOW model, which is an integration of SWAT (Soil and Water assessment Tool) and MODFLOW, is used. The results reveal strong hydraulic connection between the GW and SW in all the three catchments. In the Gilgelabay catchment, the flow from the aquifer to the river reaches dominates (annual discharge from the aquifer varies from 170 to 525,000 m(3)/day), whereas in Gumara (annual exchange rate between -6,530 and 1,710 m(3)/day) and Ribb (annual exchange rate between -8,020 and 1,453 m(3)/day) the main flow from the river reaches to the aquifer system. The flow pattern differs in the three catchments due to variations of the aquifer parameters and morphological heterogeneity. Overall, this study improves our understanding of GW-SW flow dynamics and provides insights for future research works and sustainable water management in the Nile region.

TI Microplastics in Turkish Straits System: A Case Study of the Bays and
   Straits
SO TURKISH JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
AB When plastics were first created as easy to create, long-lasting materials, there was no environmental foresight. Now all plastics pollute including land, water, groundwater have been penetrated all levels of the food chain. Plastic fragmentation into smaller-sized particles and their entering into various environments in directly small sizes created a new global issue of high concern known as microplastics. This study was undertaken for better understanding the microplastic abundance, type and size distribution in the most populous region of Turkey by analyzing surface water and water column properties in the Turkish straits system in 2016. Our results showed that surface water microplastics ranged between 0.17 and 2.52 item/m(3), while in water column abundance was between 4.12 to 34.90 items/m(3). The proportional concentration of fibers was higher in water column samples (between 100% and 59.49%) than in surface water samples (between 70.59% and 19.75%). Microplastics between 0.3 and 2.0 mm had a ratio of 76.80 %. Considering the straits' boundaries, the entrance of the Istanbul Strait had more than two fold of microplastics than that in the exit of Dardanelles in water column. Heavily industrialized/urbanized bays had higher microplastics concentration where point and non-point sources considered as disturbances.

TI Multi-Objective Surface Water Resource Management Considering Conflict
   Resolution and Utility Function Optimization
SO WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB In the present research, a multi-objective model is developed for surface water resource management in the river basin area which is connected to the lake. This model considers different components of sustainable water resource management including economic, social and environmental aspects, and simultaneously tries to resolve conflicts between different stakeholders by means of non-symmetric Nash bargaining, which is linked to the multi-objective optimization method. This study proposes a new methodology to improve Nash Conflict Resolution through finding the optimum degree of the utility function. The proposed model is examined in the Zarrineh River basin in Iran. The results show that the amount of available resources or volume of reservoirs play a significant role in determining the optimal degree of the utility function and efficiency of the proposed method in such a way that the higher amount of resources or the larger reservoirs will result in the higher optimal degree of the utility function. In the proposed multi-objective model, two different amounts of surface water inflow are considered. The first assumed amount is the long-term average flow rate and the second one is equal to 80% of the first mode, which is reduced based on the estimated impacts of climate changes. This multi-objective allocation model could supply 100 and 97.5% of the environmental demand of Lake Urmia in the first and second situations, respectively.

TI Nitrate Pollution and Preliminary Source Identification of Surface Water
   in a Semi-Arid River Basin, Using Isotopic and Hydrochemical Approaches
SO WATER
AB Nitrate contamination in rivers has raised widespread concern in the world, particularly in arid/semi-arid river basins lacking qualified water. Understanding the nitrate pollution levels and sources is critical to control the nitrogen input and promote a more sustainable water management in those basins. Water samples were collected from a typical semi-arid river basin, the Weihe River watershed, China, in October 2014. Hydrochemical assessment and nitrogen isotopic measurement were used to determine the level of nitrogen compounds and identify the sources of nitrate contamination. Approximately 32.4% of the water samples exceeded the World Health Organization ( WHO) drinking water standard for NO3--N. Nitrate pollution in the main stream of the Weihe River was obviously much more serious than in the tributaries. The delta N-15-NO3- of water samples ranged from +8.3 parts per thousand to +27.0 parts per thousand. No significant effect of denitrification on the shift in nitrogen isotopic values in surface water was observed by high dissolved oxygen ( DO) values and linear relationship diagram between NO3--N and delta N-15-NO3-, except in the Weihe River in Huayin County and Shitou River. Analyses of hydrochemistry and isotopic compositions indicate that domestic sewage and agricultural activities are the main sources of nitrate in the river.

TI Spatialization of saturated hydraulic conductivity using the Bayesian
   Maximum Entropy method: Application to wastewater infiltration areas
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Wastewater treatment, a major issue at the European level, focuses on improving surface water and groundwater quality, preserving the receiving environment, and ensuring a sustainable use of water. Soil infiltration is increasingly practiced downstream of wastewater treatment plants, particularly in rural areas without surface water bodies, as is the use of soil as an additional buffer and treatment step. However, the design of infiltration areas on heterogeneous soils remains an extremely complex task due to the costly and time-consuming spatial measurement of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks). This article proposes integrating 2D electrical resistivity tomography and infiltration tests into a Bayesian Maximum Entropy method, yielding a vertical mapping of soil heterogeneities at a metric scale. This updated method will facilitate infiltration area design in a heterogeneous soil setting.

TI State of SuDS delivery in the United Kingdom
SO WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL
AB Sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) have become a key tool in the design of water sensitive cities, due to their capacity to store and attenuate surface water, and to treat runoff. SuDS implementation requires a complex alignment of planning frameworks, engineering designs, construction practices, maintenance processes, community buy-in and ownership agreements. To understand this alignment, and build an evidence base on the implementation and management of UK SuDS, a questionnaire was distributed to 50000 industry professionals by the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management. The findings suggested that SuDS are beginning to become the norm, although harder' solutions tend to prevail. Additionally, design and construction remain weakly regulated, and there is a lack of clear legal framework on SuDS ownership and maintenance. Expert practitioners supported the need for a single adoption method, coordinated by the local authority and suggested policy changes to make SuDS obligatory.

AB Riverbank filtration (RBF) is considered a "natural" filtration technique in which the bed and bank areas of a river serve as "treatment" zones for the river water. When wells are placed adjacent to a river and pumped, the treatment zones remove most surface water pollutants. This technology has been in operation for more than a century in Europe and for more than half a century in the United States. In many areas of the world, particularly in the populated regions of India and China, RBF has significant potential. Riverbank filtration can be used along perennial as well as ephemeral rivers in desert countries. However, studies are needed to evaluate the connectivity of the surface water and ground water, dynamic variation of the redox zone(s), flash flood impacts, and climate changes for the sustainable operation of RBF systems in desert environments.

TI The status and quantification of de facto water reuse in South Africa -
   a review
SO WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The practice of discharging insufficiently treated wastewater to surface water used for potable use (de facto reuse) is common globally. Although de facto reuse provides a sustainable supply of water, it also affects the environment and human health negatively because the inadequately treated effluents contain contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). Therefore, there is a need to determine the extent of de facto reuse in water bodies of South Africa (SA) and thus assess the potential environmental and health risks associated with the reuse of insufficiently treated wastewater in the country. This review summarizes the status of de facto reuse in SA and its negative impact on human health and the environment. Furthermore, the review provides background information on water reuse and as well as the current treatment technologies available in the country for potable water reuse. The use of a geographic information system (GIS) model in combination with caffeine (a wastewater tracer that is abundant in SA surface water systems) for the quantification of de facto reuse is also cited. Such methods, it is envisaged, will enable water management authorities to make well informed decisions regarding water quality issues in SA.

TI Oxic water column methanogenesis as a major component of aquatic CH4
   fluxes
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Methanogenesis has traditionally been assumed to occur only in anoxic environments, yet there is mounting, albeit indirect, evidence of methane (CH4) production in oxic marine and freshwaters. Here we present the first direct, ecosystem-scale demonstration of methanogenesis in oxic lake waters. This methanogenesis appears to be driven by acetoclastic production, and is closely linked to algal dynamics. We show that oxic water methanogenesis is a significant component of the overall CH4 budget in a small, shallow lake, and provide evidence that this pathway may be the main CH4 source in large, deep lakes and open oceans. Our results challenge the current global understanding of aquatic CH4 dynamics, and suggest a hitherto unestablished link between pelagic CH4 emissions and surface-water primary production. This link may be particularly sensitive to widespread and increasing human influences on aquatic ecosystem primary productivity.

TI Shifted dynamics of plankton communities in a restored lake: exploring
   the effects of climate change on phenology through four decades
SO CLIMATE RESEARCH
AB Lake surface temperatures have increased globally in recent decades. Climate change can affect lake biota directly via enhanced water temperatures, shorter ice cover duration and prolonged stratification, and indirectly via changes in species interactions. Changes in the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton and zooplankton can further affect whole lake ecosystems. However, separating the effects of climate change from the more direct and dominating effects of nutrients is a challenge. Our aim was to explore the ecological effects of climate change while accounting for the effects of re-oligotrophication in Lake Mjosa, the largest lake in Norway. While restoration measures since the 1970s have resulted in strongly reduced nutrient levels, the surface water temperature has increased by almost 0.4 degrees C decade(-1) during the same period. We analysed long-term trends and abrupt changes in environmental and biological time series as well as changes in the seasonal dynamics of individual plankton taxa. The general long-term trends in phenology were diverging for phytoplankton (later peaks) vs. zooplankton (earlier peaks). However, individual taxa of both phytoplankton and zooplankton displayed earlier peaks. Earlier peaks of the phytoplankton group Cryptophyceae can be explained by increased spring temperature or other climate-related changes. Earlier onset of population growth of certain zooplankton species (Limnocalanus macrurus and Holopedium gibberum) can also be explained by climatic change, either directly (earlier temperature increase) or more indirectly (earlier availability of Cryptophyceae as a food source). In the long run, climate-related changes in both phytoplankton and zooplankton phenology may have implications for the fish communities of this lake.

TI Securing drinking water resources for a coastal city under global
   change: Scientific and institutional perspectives
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Most urbanized coastal cities lack fresh water resources and rely on water supply from adjacent inland watersheds. Numerous threats, including global climate change and various human activities, affect both the quantity and quality of fresh water available. Here we carried out a case study of Xiamen, a coastal city in subtropical China. Long-term data analysis showed the increasing floods and droughts that are the expected main impacts of climate change on water quality and quantity. Increasing eutrophication and harmful algal blooms in recent decades threaten water quality in Jiangdong reservoir, which supplies raw water to Xiamen and other coastal areas. In addition to excessive manganese (Mn) in surface water, other potential threats to water quality and human health include various emerging contaminants; these threats have all been scientifically detected but are beyond the scope of routine water-monitoring programs. Based on lessons learned from water supply management initiatives currently in progress, we proposed a conceptual framework for "source-to-tap" integrated water management in an attempt to secure clean and safe water supply. Long-term monitoring and research, adaptive management and actions to reduce nutrients and other pollutants loading are vital to protect water sources, and measures to adapt to climate change should be considered to achieve these goals. Institutional enablers for transboundary and cross-sector management were also suggested: enacting integrated water policies, developing an ecological compensation policy, authorizing the management institution, improving the incentive mechanism of cross-border compensation and transfer payments considering environmental responsibility, and encouraging multiple-stakeholder involvement.

TI Simulation of Climate Change Impact on A Coastal Aquifer under Arid
   Climate. The Tadjourah Aquifer (Republic of Djibouti, Horn of Africa)
SO WATER
AB The Republic of Djibouti has an area of 23,000 km(2), a coastline 370 km long and a population of 820,000 inhabitants. It experiences an arid climate characterized by high daytime temperatures and low and irregular rainfall (average of 140 mm/year), resulting in continuous periods of drought. These difficult climatic conditions and the absence of perennial surface water have progressively led to an intensive exploitation of groundwater to meet increasing water demands in all sectors (drinking water, agriculture and industries). In coastal areas, seawater intrusion constitutes a significant additional risk of groundwater degradation. This study is focused on the coastal aquifer of Tadjourah which supplies water to the city of Tadjourah, currently comprising 21,000 inhabitants. The main objective of this work is to assess the current resources of this aquifer; its capacity to satisfy, or not, the projected water demands during coming years; and to analyze its vulnerability to seawater intrusion within the frame of climate change. Three RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathway) were used to simulate different climate scenarios up to 2100. The simulated rainfall series allowed to deduce the aquifer recharge up to 2100. The code Seawat was used to model seawater intrusion into the aquifer, using the recharge data deduced from the climate scenarios. The results indicate that the risk of contamination of the Tadjourah coastal aquifer by seawater intrusion is high. The long-term and sustainable exploitation of this aquifer must take into consideration the impact of climate change.

TI A 9-year time-series of planktonic foraminifer fluxes and environmental

   1990-1999
SO PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB A 9-year study of planktonic foraminifer fluxes was conducted in the Bering Sea (Station AB) and in the central subarctic Pacific (Station SA). Results clearly reflected variations of the water mass characteristics in the upper layers. The 9-year means of total foraminifer fluxes were the same (1400 shells m(-2) d(-1)) at both stations. However, total foraminifer flux at Station AB tended to show its primary maximum during fall (October-December) and its secondary maximum in spring (April-June), whereas the primary maximum appeared in spring and the secondary maximum in fall at Station SA. Seasonal variation was more apparent at hemipelagic Station AB than at pelagic Station SA. Planktonic foraminifers found at both stations were of six species: Neogloboquadrina pachyderma, Globigerina umbilicata, Globigerinita glutinata, Globigerina quinqueloba, Globorotalia wilesi, and Orbulina universa. The foraminifer assemblages at the two stations reflected the temperature difference in the surface waters. The variable %G. umbilicata tended to be high in the warm surface waters during the summers. The temporal and geographical variation of %G. quinqueloba indicated that this taxon prefers regions with relatively low diatom fluxes. A notable appearance of O. universa occurred in 1997 at Station SA. During this period, other measured biogenic particle fluxes, such as those of diatoms, were low. This unusual 1997 event may be a reflection of global climatic change that happened to be observed in the central subarctic Pacific Ocean. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Greenhouse production contributes to pesticide occurrences in Swedish
   streams
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Greenhouse and other covered cultivation systems have increased globally over the past several decades, leading to considerably improved product quality and productivity per land area unit. However, there is a paucity in information regarding the environmental impacts of covered production systems, especially regarding pesticides entering the surrounding environment. Aiming to address this knowledge gap, we collected grab samples downstream of greenhouses from seven Swedish streams every 14 days during a 12 month period. In three of the streams, samples were also taken upstream of the greenhouses and in four of the streams time-integrated samples were collected by TIMFIE samplers in the period between grab sampling occasions. The samples were analyzed for 28 substances (27 that were permitted for use in greenhouse production systems in Sweden and one degradation product to a permitted substance). Pesticide use journals were collected from the greenhouse producers for the 12 month period. The results were examined for indications of greenhouse contributions to detection frequencies, maximum and average concentrations, and potential ecotoxicicity in several ways: (1) comparing locations downstream of greenhouses with registered use of a substance with those without registered use, (2) comparing results from this study with those from the Swedish environmental monitoring program of pesticides in surface water from catchments with no greenhouses from the same period and region, (3) comparing concentration trends with registered pesticide application times in the greenhouses, and (4) comparing up-and downstream concentrations. The results strongly suggest that greenhouse applications do contribute to pesticide occurrences, maximum and median concentrations for most of the pesticides included in this study, and to potential toxicity to aquatic organisms for several of them, most notably imidacloprid, acetamiprid, carbendazim, and pirimicarb.

AB The quality of irrigation water has a considerable impact on what plants can be successfully grown, the productivity of these plants, and water infiltration and other soil physical conditions. Irrigated agriculture is dependent on an adequate water supply of usable quality. To avoid problems when using poor quality water supplies, there must be sound planning to ensure that the quality of water available is put to the best use.
   The usage of irrigation water by Polat and Silrgti Streams is one of the most important factors in respect to the intensification of agricultural activities in the Akcadag Basin. Responsible and accurate use of these factors by means of GIS is of vital importance. This study aims to visualize waters defined to be qualified to be used for irrigation or drinking purposes with the aid of GIS and to ensure the sustainable use of surface waters in the Akcadag Basin.
   The most common measure to assess irrigation in water is called the Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR). The SAR defines sodicity in terms of the relative concentration of sodium (Na) compared to the sum of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) ions in a sample. The SAR assesses the potential for infiltration problems due to a sodium imbalance in irrigation water. The highest value was found in SAR station 2 (0.473) while the lowest value (0.027) was calculated in the station 7. The selected stations should be monitored in wet and dry seasons in order to provide a more accurate interpretation of the area and to ensure proper use. It is possible to aim to protect water resources and make people reach these resources in a healthy way, to create a sustainable water management policy by means of different monitoring tools to be used for the monitoring of the area.

TI Long-Term Changes in Inland Water Surface Temperature across China Based
   on Remote Sensing Data
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
AB Water surface temperature is a direct indication of climate change. However, it is not clear how China's inland waters have responded to climate change in the past using a consistent method on a national scale. In this study, we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from 2000 to 2015 to study the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of water surface temperature in China using the wavelet transform method. The results showed the following: 1) the freezing date of China inland water has shown a significant delaying trend during the past 16 years with an average rate of -1.5 days yr(-1); 2) the shift of the 0 degrees C isotherm position of surface water across China has clear seasonal changes, which first moved eastward about 25 degrees and northward about 15 degrees, and then gradually moved back after the year 2009; 3) during the past 16 years, the 0 degrees C isotherm of China's surface water has gradually moved north by about 0.09 degrees in the latitude direction and east by about 1 degrees in the longitude direction; and 4) the interannual variation of water surface temperature in 17 lakes of China showed a similar fluctuation trend that increased before 2010, and then decreased. The El Nino and La Nina around 2010 could have impacts on the turning point of the annual variation of water surface temperature. This study validated the response of China's inland surface water to global climate change and improved the understanding of the wetland environment's response to climate change.

AB The paper makes qualitative and quantitative analyses of heavy metal contamination of surface waters in lasi City. The examination of data acquisited from the specific sections of the rivers Bahlui (upstream section, Iasi water treatment plant, Holboca section, downstream section, Iasi water treatment station), Nicolina (quarterly data from the established monitoring system) was performed, based on data provided by the Environmental Protection Agency of Iasi District and Prut Water Department from Iasi. A similar analysis was performed for Chirita. and Ciric water accumulations. The following heavy metal species were analyzed: Total Iron (Fell), Lead (PbII), Nickel (NiII), Chrome (CrVI), Cadmium (CdII), Copper (Cull) and Zinc (ZnII). In addition, the quantification of the impact induced by heavy metals on the surface waters in Iasi city was carried out, based on the determined values of the global contamination parameter, according to Rojanschi method. The impact analysis showed that a significant contamination with Fe(II) for Bahlui River exists for the time interval 2001-2003, as well as with Pb during 2001-2002. This signifies that the environment shows the evidences of a certain discomfort degree for living forms generated by the human activity, but within allowable limits. For Nicolina River, the global contamination parameter for Ni(II) evaluated for the time interval 2003-2005 indicates that the river contamination due to the human activity is also within the pen-nissible limits. The Chirita Accumulation suffered a significant contamination during 2003-2004, related to total iron Fe(II) levels, which began to improve since 2005. A similar result has been obtained for the Ciric accumulations, as well. Since these results were obtained for time intervals when economic activities were stagnant, it is considered that the monitoring process is still necessary.

TI Integration of Hydrochemistry and Stable Isotopes for Assessing
   Groundwater Recharge and Evaporation in Pre- and Post-Rainy Seasons in
   Hua County, China
SO NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB Groundwater resource management is crucial for promoting sustainable development in areas with surface water scarcity, such as Hua County in China. This paper aims to estimate groundwater recharge and evaporation during the pre- and post-rainy seasons in Hua County. The non-equilibrium evaporation model was established to quantify the degree of evaporation. Ternary end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) was used to evaluate the contributions of recharge sources to groundwater recharge. The concentrations of major ions in surface water and groundwater showed some differences, which may be due to differences in their lithological classes and hydrogeochemical evolution. The ion concentrations of both surface water and groundwater were observed to be lower in the post-rainy season, because rainfall infiltration during the rainy season diluted ion concentrations. The Gibbs diagram, end-member diagram, and & delta;H-2 versus & delta;O-18 diagram all revealed that groundwater was affected by evaporation to some extent, especially in the pre-rainy season. The non-equilibrium evaporation model showed that the remaining proportions of evaporation calculated using O-18 and H-2 were 0.96 and 0.94%, respectively, during the pre-rainy season and 0.97% and 0.96%, respectively, during the post-rainy season. According to EMMA, the mean contributions of subsurface lateral flow, precipitation infiltration, and river percolation to groundwater were 47%, 28%, and 25%, respectively, during the pre-rainy season and 57%, 30%, and 13%, respectively, in the post-rainy season. The findings of the present study demonstrated that integration of hydrochemistry and isotopic signatures supports better understanding of groundwater recharge and evaporation processes.

TI Hydrogeochemical Characteristics and Controlling Factors of the Lhasa
   River under the Influence of Anthropogenic Activities
SO WATER
AB Anthropogenic activities have had diversiform impacts on the surrounding river and environments. A study on the surface water of the Lhasa River Basin was undertaken to assess its hydrogeochemical characteristics under the influence of anthropogenic activities. A total of 16 samples collected from the Lhasa River were analyzed for pH, electric conductivity (EC), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), total dissolved solids (TDS), major cations (K+, Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+), major anions (Cl-, SO42-, HCO3-, and NO3-), and trace metals. The pH of the analyzed water samples varied from 6.40 to 9.10, indicating alkaline in nature. The EC values varied from 77.3 to 213 s/cm while the TDS values varied from 73.37 to 217.55 mg/L. HCO3- and SO42- are the dominant anions while Ca2+ and Na+ are the dominant cations in the river water. The concentration of alkaline earth metals (Ca2+ + Mg2+) exceed the alkali metals (Na+ + K+) and HCO3- dominates over SO42- + Cl- concentrations in the majority of the surface water samples. Ca2+-Mg2+-HCO3- and Ca2+-Mg2+-Cl- are the dominant hydrogeochemical facies in the surface water of the area. The water chemistry is mainly controlled by rock weathering with secondary contribution from anthropogenic sources. The content of trace elements in the Lhasa River is low, basically at the natural background value. The high content of individual elements is mainly due to the mineral resource exploitation and geothermal resources in the basin. Countermeasures and attention should be payed to these aspects, such as the construction of water conservancy facilities, urban economic development, the development of mining activities, and sewage and wastewater discharge, so as to protect the water quality and sustainable development of the Lhasa River Basin.

TI Simulation and optimization coupling model for soil salinization and
   waterlogging control in the Urad irrigation area, North China
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB How to rationally optimize the allocation of surface water and groundwater resources in saline-alkali areas is a difficult problem in current model optimization. Based on an interval two-stage stochastic programming (ITSP) method, this paper considers the system risk involved in saline-alkali land treatment, follows a robust optimization method, and constructs an interval two-stage data-driven subrobust optimization (ITDRO) model, which can optimize the distribution of groundwater and surface water for different crops and realize the combination of wells and canals through the joint dispatch of surface water and groundwater. This paper takes the Urad Irrigation Area as the research object, and the obtained results provide water distribution objectives under situations of multiple sources of water, multiple crops, and different robust coefficients. After the successful calibration and verification of the SaltMod model, the water distribution target is taken as the main input parameter and substituted into the simulation model based on the principle of water and salt balance. The output includes soil salinity, drainage salinity, groundwater salinity (GWS), groundwater table (GWT) depth, and drainage. The results show that the integrated ITDRO and SaltMod model can control the groundwater level below the critical depth under the premise of satisfying crop irrigation, reducing the groundwater level by approximately 0.75 m and the GWS in the irrigation area by approximately 0.68 g/L, which can provide a reference for the prevention and control of soil salinization and waterlogging. This approach is suitable for arid and semiarid regions that face similar problems.

TI Environmental and ecological controls of coral community metabolism on
   Palmyra Atoll
SO CORAL REEFS
AB Accurate predictions of how coral reefs may respond to global climate change hinge on understanding the natural variability to which these ecosystems are exposed and to which they contribute. We present high-resolution estimates of net community calcification (NCC) and net community production (NCP) from Palmyra Atoll, an uninhabited, near-pristine coral reef ecosystem in the central Pacific. In August-October 2012, we employed a combination of Lagrangian and Eulerian frameworks to establish high spatial (similar to 2.5 km(2)) and temporal (hourly) resolution coral community metabolic estimates. Lagrangian drifts, all conducted during daylight hours, resulted in NCC estimates of -51 to 116 mmol C m(-2) h(-1), although most NCC estimates were in the range of 0-40 mmol C m(-2) h(-1). Lagrangian drift NCP estimates ranged from -7 to 67 mmol C m(-2) h(-1). In the Eulerian setup, we present carbonate system parameters (dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, pH, and pCO(2)) at sub-hourly resolution through several day-night cycles and provide hourly NCC and NCP rate estimates. We compared diel cycles of all four carbonate system parameters to the offshore surface water (0-50 m depth) and show large departures from offshore surface water chemistry. Hourly Eulerian estimates of NCC aggregated over the entire study ranged from 14 to 53 mmol C m(-2) h(-1), showed substantial variability during daylight hours, and exhibited a diel cycle with elevated NCC in the afternoons and depressed, but positive, NCC at night. The Eulerian NCP range was very high (-55 to 177 mmol C m(-2) h(-1)) and exhibited strong variability during daylight hours. Principal components analysis revealed that NCC and NCP were most closely aligned with diel cycle forcing, whereas the NCC/NCP ratio was most closely aligned with reef community composition. Our analysis demonstrates that ecological community composition is the primary determinant of coral reef biogeochemistry on a near-pristine reef and that reef biogeochemistry is likely to be responsive to human behaviors that alter community composition.

TI On the Use of System Performance Metrics for Assessing the Value of
   Incremental Water-Use Permits
SO JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB A novel approach on quantifying the value of an incremental surface water-use permit in an integrated water resources system consisting of groundwater, surface water, off-stream reservoir, and desalinated seawater sources is presented. First, a stochastic framework that accounts for demand uncertainties and variations in climatic parameters was used to generate regional demand and supply realizations. Second, a linked optimization-simulation model was used to navigate through complex system constraints and sustainable operational constraints. The resulting decision variables were then used to calculate system performance metrics, demonstrating the benefit of an increase in surface-water withdrawals at high flows. The Monte Carlo-based model took advantage of distributed computing capabilities on a private cloud computing system to significantly reduce the total run time. The model codes were developed in two different software environments, executed on different platforms, in which information was exchanged through an inter-process communication (IPC) protocol. The major contribution of this research is toward the practical use of stochastic-based integrated surface/groundwater-use permit application for a complex water resources system. The approach is demonstrated using Tampa Bay Water's integrated water resources system. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI Method validation for the analysis of pesticide residue in aqueous
   environment
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB Rapid industrialization and urbanization have led to severe pollution into water resources which limits to reach safe drinking and irrigation water globally. One of the most important pollutants of environment that brought along with industrialization and technology are pesticides. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the pesticide residues in Dim Stream, due to intense touristic and agricultural activities in the region. Thus, four locations alongside the river were selected for sampling to evaluate the pesticide residue in the stream. The water samples were collected representing the rainy and dry seasons and extracted according to the Quechers method which is validated in terms of accuracy, specificity, limit of detection (LOD), and quantification (LOQ). Pesticide residues were analyzed by injecting LC-MSMS and GC-MS. The most recurrent pesticides were cypermethrin, endosulfan, deltamethrin, dicofol, metribuzin, parathion-methyl, permethrin, malathion, and tetradifon in the samples. Some of the levels of pesticides detected in water were significantly high compared with guideline values set by the Surface Water Quality Regulation of Turkey, EU, and World Health Organization, and this may be hazardous to aquatic life and human health. The obtained 18 recoveries of pesticides in the samples varied between 70 and 120%. LOD was ranged 19 from 0.23 to 9.67 mu g/L. LOQ of 11 of the pesticides were higher than 1 mu g/L.

TI The Surface Water Chemistry (SWatCh) database: a standardized global
   database of water chemistry to facilitate large-sample hydrological
   research
SO EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
AB Openly accessible global-scale surface water chemistry datasets are urgently needed to detect widespread trends and problems, to help identify their possible solutions, and to determine critical spatial data gaps where more monitoring is required. Existing datasets are limited with respect to availability, sample size and/or sampling frequency, and geographic scope. These limitations inhibit researchers from tackling emerging transboundary water chemistry issues - for example, the detection and understanding of delayed recovery from freshwater acidification. Here, we begin to address these limitations by compiling the global Surface Water Chemistry (SWatCh) database, available on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6484939; Rotteveel and Heubach, 2021). We collect, clean, standardize, and aggregate open-access data provided by six national and international programs and research groups (United Nations Environment Programme; Hartmann et al., 2019; Environment and Climate Change Canada; the United States of America National Water Quality Monitoring Council; the European Environment Agency; and the United States National Science Foundation McMurdo Dry Valleys Long-Term Ecological Research Network) in order to compile a database containing information on sites, methods, and samples, and a geospatial information system (GIS) shapefile of site locations. We remove poor-quality data (e.g., values flagged as "suspect" or "rejected"), standardize variable naming conventions and units, and perform other data cleaning steps required for statistical analysis. The database contains water chemistry data for streams, rivers, canals, ponds, lakes, and reservoirs across seven continents, 24 variables, 33 722 sites, and over 5 million samples collected between 1960 and 2022. Similar to prior research, we identify critical spatial data gaps on the African and Asian continents, highlighting the need for more data collection and sharing initiatives in these areas, especially considering that freshwater ecosystems in these environs are predicted to be among the most heavily impacted by climate change. We identify the main challenges associated with compiling global databases - limited data availability, dissimilar sample collection and analysis methodology, and reporting ambiguity - and provide recommended solutions. By addressing these challenges and consolidating data from various sources into one standardized, openly available, high-quality, and transboundary database, SWatCh allows users to conduct powerful and robust statistical analyses of global surface water chemistry.

TI Climate Change and Sustainable Irrigation Management in Bangladesh
SO CLIMATE CHANGE AND FOOD SECURITY IN SOUTH ASIA
AB Predictions from different studies reveal that the agricultural sector will face the acute challenges due to climate change. Models have shown that due to such changes, the rainy season will be wetter due to increased rainfall and dry season will be drier clue to higher temperatures. This will cause more surface water bodies to dry out making less water available for irrigating crops in dry season. Presently, about 75% of total irrigated area is based on groundwater resources. Due to drying out of surface water bodies, additional pressure will be exerted on groundwater to meet crop water demand. High loss in irrigation systems will also invite more groundwater to pump. This extended withdrawal will threaten sustainable groundwater use. Reports are available on the declining trends of groundwater levels both in urban and some pocket rural areas in Dhaka, Joydebpur, Comilla, and Barind tracts of Bangladesh. Excessive withdrawal of groundwater is one of the principal reasons for water table declination. Though the water loss is much higher in paddy field, it is also quite remarkable in non-rice crop fields. Obviously, the system efficiencies are much lower for the crops. Therefore, it is important to devise ways and means to reduce water losses in conveyance, distribution and application methods. Innovative works are already in progress to address these issues. Alternate drying and wetting for rice irrigation, improved earthen channel, buried pipe water distribution system and hose pipe irrigation for both rice and non-rice crops and low cost simple drip irrigation system for high value horticultural crops (like tomato, watermelon, egg plants etc.) are becoming popular day by day. Drought is another regular phenomenon that has to be addressed properly because a severe drought reduces production of Aman rice grown in monsoon by about 90%. So, in the drought prone area, proper irrigation facility should be developed and at the same time efforts to be employed to develop drought tolerant crop varieties. In the coastal areas, sea level rise will increase salinity intrusion further inland to grasp non-saline agricultural lands. Therefore, suitable crop varieties to withstand soil salinity need to be developed. At the same time, improved method of cultivation to grow high value crops in the coastal saline areas of Bangladesh will also be developed.

TI Modelling Peatland Hydrology: Three Cases from Northern Europe
SO POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
AB Many of the peatlands that used to extend over large parts of Northern Europe have been reclaimed for agriculture. Human influence continues to have a major impact on the hydrology of those that remain, affecting river flow and groundwater levels. In order to understand this hydrology it is necessary to analyze and assess the groundwater and surface water system as a whole. The SIMGRO model was developed for such situations: it simulates groundwater flow in the saturated and unsaturated zones and also surface water flow. Being physically-based, it is suitable for application to situations with changing hydrological conditions and for practical aspects of water management in peatlands. This paper describes the application of the model to different hydrological situations in the Netherlands, Poland and Lithuania. The 3 cases deal with aspects of flooding, natural flow regime and flood storage in relation to suitable conditions for agriculture and nature. The calibration of the model for the cases was limited, but the simulation results show that the estimates of the discharges and groundwater levels were satisfactory, demonstrating that the model is an adequate tool for simulating the hydrological system, and has the potential to assess the impact of different measures. The Dutch case demonstrates that lowland basins where the groundwater has been lowered by extensive land drainage can be restored by restricting the inflow of surface water from the upper parts of the basin: peak flows are significantly reduced. For the Polish case, the damming of ditches in the valley of the Biebrza River could significantly improve the water regime in the peatlands of this floodplain. For the Lithuanian case, the flow regime for the Dovine River could be made more natural if sluice gates were replaced by overflow spill weirs. Understanding the hydrological system is crucial for sustainable land development and effective soil and nature conservation. The different measures simulated in the 3 cases illustrate SIMGRO's potential to simulate hydrological measures.

TI Land use/land cover water quality nexus: quantifying anthropogenic
   influences on surface water quality
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB Anthropogenic forces widely influence the composition, configuration, and trend of land use and land cover (LULC) changes with potential implications for surface water quality. These changes have the likelihood of generating non-point source pollution with additional environmental implications for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Monitoring the scope and trajectory of LULC change is pivotal for region-wide planning, tracking the sustainability of natural resources, and meeting the information needs of policy makers. A good comprehension of the dynamics of anthropogenic drivers (proximate and underlying) that influence such changes in LULC is important because any potential adverse change in LULC that may be inimical to sustainable water quality might be addressed at the anthropogenic driver level rather than the LULC change stage. Using a dense time stack of Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper images, a hydrologic water quality and socio-geospatial modeling framework, this study quantifies the role of anthropogenic drivers of LULC change on total suspended solids and total phosphorus concentrations in the Lower Chippewa River Watershed, Wisconsin, at three time steps-1990, 2000, and 2010. Results of the study demonstrated that proximate drivers of LULC change accounted for between 32 and 59 % of the concentration and spatial distribution of total suspended solids, while the extent of phosphorus impairment attributed to the proximate drivers ranged between 31 and 42 %.

AB A century ago more than half of the Netherlands consisted of wetlands, including the Pleistocene cover sand areas that are elevated well above sea level. Most of the former wetlands have been cultivated, whereas the remaining wetlands suffer from acidification, eutrophication and a decline of groundwater or surface water levels. Sustainable wetland restoration is now one of the primary targets in the governmental policy regarding these valuable ecological reserves. The restoration potential of wetlands is largely limited by their geographical situation and the governing hydrological system(s). Sustainable restoration requires in-depth knowledge of the hydrological systems of the different wetland types. All aspects of the hydrological system need to be known including surface water, groundwater, stream sediments, stream banks, technical infrastructure and related physical, chemical and biological features and processes. In the present study, the influence of the water system was unraveled for the major Dutch freshwater wetland types on the basis of field-scale projects and with the help of modelling. In the Netherlands, where different types of land use are closely packed together, structural changes in agriculture and water supply are needed to achieve the restoration targets. However, even structural changes in agriculture will hardly be able to decrease the nutrient load to the level required for oligotrophic wetland systems. Restoration of the groundwater regime (both levels and discharge) to its former natural situation is often impossible. Wetland restoration can only be successful if a new balance in these conditions can be found.

TI Microplastic Pollution in the Surface Waters from Plain and Mountainous
   Lakes in Siberia, Russia
SO WATER
AB Microplastics (MPs) contaminations of freshwater and marine environments has become a global issue. Lakes in southern Siberia provide a wide range of ecosystem services and are essential elements in the annual and interannual runoff distribution of the Great Siberian Rivers. However, the extent of their MPs pollution remains unknown. In this paper, for the first time, we analyze the concentrations, composition, and spatial distribution of MPs in six lakes in southern Siberia. The studied lakes are located both in the Altai mountains and the West Siberian plain. Some of them are significantly impacted by human activities, while others are located in protected areas with no permanent population. Nevertheless, MPs were detected in all of the studied lakes. MPs concentrations ranged from 4 to 26 MPs L-1. Comparing with other inland lakes, South Siberian lakes presented moderate MPs concentrations. Among the registered MPs forms, fragments and films were dominant, with a size range between 31 and 60 nm. The MPs' sources depend on local human activities (fishing, transport, landfilling). Therefore, sufficiently high concentrations were observed even in remote lakes. The present study set a baseline that emphasizes the need for increased attention to waste management and sustainable water use in Siberian freshwater environments.

TI Global Corrections to Reference Irradiance Spectra for Non-Clear-Sky
   Conditions
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Photochemical reactions in surface waters play important roles in element cycling and in the removal of organic contaminants, among other processes. A central environmental variable affecting photochemical processes in surface waters is the incoming solar irradiance, as this initiates these processes. However, clear-sky incident irradiance spectra are often used when evaluating the fate of aquatic contaminants, leading to an overestimation of contaminant decay rates due to photochemical transformation. In this work, incident irradiance satellite data were used to develop global-scale non-clear-sky correction factors for commonly used reference irradiance spectra. Non-clear-sky conditions can decrease incident irradiance by over 90% depending on the geographic location and time of the year, with latitudes above 40 degrees N being most heavily affected by seasons. The impact of non-clear-sky conditions on contaminant half-lives was illustrated in a case study of triclosan in lake Greifensee, which showed a 39% increase in the triclosan half-life over the course of a year under non-clear-sky conditions. A global annual average correction factor of 0.76 was determined as an approximate way to account for non-clear-sky conditions. The correction factors are developed at monthly and seasonal resolutions for every location on the globe between 70 degrees N and 60 degrees S at a 4 km spatial resolution and can be used by researchers, practitioners, and regulators who need improved estimates of incident irradiance.

TI Inhibition of bacterial activities by solar radiation in nearshore
   waters and the Gulf of Mexico
SO AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB The effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation on thymidine and leucine incorporation were examined in surface waters from the Gulf of Mexico and Santa Rosa Sound, a mesotrophic estuary in northwest Florida, USA. Whole and 0.8 mu m filtered surface waters were incubated with H-3-thymidine and C-14-leucine in UV transparent containers under natural solar radiation. Solar radiation was either not filtered (samples exposed to UV-B, UV-A, and photosynthetically active radiation, PAR), filtered through Mylar 500D (samples exposed to UV-A and PAR), or filtered through Acrylite OP3 (samples exposed only to PAR). In Santa Rosa Sound, thymidine incorporation was inhibited an average of 44% relative to dark controls when exposed to unfiltered solar radiation. PAR contributed 23% to the total thymidine inhibition, while UV-A and UV-B contributed 37% and 39%, respectively, to total inhibition. Leucine incorporation in Santa Rosa Sound was inhibited 29% by full solar radiation. The majority of the total leucine inhibition was due to UV-B (83%), while PAR only treatments showed leucine incorporation rates 10% higher than dark controls. For the Gulf of Mexico experiments, full solar radiation inhibited thymidine incorporation approximately twice as much as leucine incorporation. However, there were no consistent patterns in differences due to different wavelengths. Both thymidine and leucine incorporation were inhibited to a greater extent in <0.8 mu m filtered water samples than in whole water samples, suggesting that the presence of primary producers may mediate the detrimental effects of solar radiation on bacterioplankton. Surface water was also incubated in situ with thymidine at fixed depths in UV transparent and darkened containers at 3 locations in the Gulf of Mexico. Total inhibition was 60 to 70% at the surface and was evident to 15 m. Comparison with radiometric data and DNA dosimeters indicated that UV-B exerted the greatest effect in the upper 5 m while below that the inhibition was most Likely due to longer wavelengths. Our results suggest that both UV and visible solar radiation can negatively affect bacterial metabolism and failure to take into account the effects of light may result in the overestimation of bacterioplankton production in surface waters.

TI Rapid surface water expansion due to increasing artificial reservoirs
   and aquaculture ponds in North China Plain
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB Water shortage has severely threatened the North China Plain (NCP), a typical grain bowl and highly populated and urbanized area in China. As surface water body area (SWA) is a critical variable for measuring regional water resources, understanding its changes and driving mechanisms is important for sustainable water management. Here, we examine the interannual variations and trends of SWA in the NCP during 1987-2020 by using all the available Landsat imagery, the water indices-and threshold-based water mapping algorithm, and cloud computing platform Google Earth Engine (GEE). The results show that SWA of the NCP significantly (p < 0.05) expanded by 68.0% (from 4740.0 km(2) in 1987 to 7963.7 km(2) in 2020) at a rate of 101.9 km(2)/yr. The most remarkable expansion of SWA happened in Shandong Province (75.0 km(2)/yr), which is an increasingly important aquaculture production region. We find that the increasing artificial reservoirs/lakes due to the implementation of water projects, together with aquaculture development, are the main drivers for the expansion of SWA in the NCP. The expansion of SWA caused a significant increase in water evaporation (0.09 km(3)/yr) in the NCP as the shallow nature of these artificial reservoirs/lakes and aquaculture ponds could lead to excess evaporation because of the frequent heating and cooling cycles due to their limited abilities to store energy. Similarly, Shandong Province experienced the most rapid increase in water evaporation (0.03 km(3)/yr), which could accelerate the loss of water storage at a rate of 8.4-14.4 mm/yr in the regions covered by surface water bodies. Continuous temperature rise (0.02-0.06 ?/yr) in the future, as predicted by the climate models (CMIP5) under the two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios of medium (RCP 4.5) and high (RCP 8.5) greenhouse gas emission, could further increase water evaporation, which may add more pressure to regional water shortage. This study warns that, despite an observed significant SWA expansion, water shortage remains a major concern in the NCP.

AB We assessed environmental tracers in groundwater in two contrasting basins in Namibia; the Kuiseb Basin, which is a predominantly dry area and the Cuvelai-Etosha Basin, which is prone to alternating floods and droughts. We aimed to determine why the quality of groundwater was different in these two basins which occur in an arid environment. We analysed groundwater and surface water for the stable isotope ratios of hydrogen (delta H-2) and oxygen (delta O-18) by cavity ring-down spectroscopy and metals by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The delta H-2 and delta O-18 of surface water in the Cuvelai-Etosha Basin plot on an evaporation trend below the global meteoric water line (GMWL) and the local meteoric water line (LMWL). The delta H-2 and delta O-18 of some groundwater samples in the Cuvelai-Etosha Basin also plot on the evaporation trend, indicating recharge by evaporated rain or evaporated surface water. In contrast, the delta H-2 and delta O-18 of groundwater samples in the Kuiseb Basin plot mostly along the GMWL and the LMWL, indicating direct recharge from unevaporated rain or unevaporated surface water. Fifty percent of groundwater samples in the Cuvelai-Etosha Basin was potable (salinity < 1 ppt) compared to 79% in the Kuiseb Basin. The high salinity in the groundwater of the Cuvelai-Etosha Basin does not appear to be caused by evaporation of water (evapo-concentration) on surface prior to groundwater recharge, but rather by the weathering of the Kalahari sediments. The low salinity in the Kuiseb Basin derives from rapid recharge of groundwater by unevaporated rain and limited weathering of the crystalline rocks. The order of abundance of cations in the Kuiseb Basin is Na > K > Ca > Mg vs. Na > Mg> Ca > K for the Cuvelai-Etosha Basin. For metals in the Kuiseb Basin the order of abundance is Fe > Al > V> As > Zn vs. Al > Fe > V> As > Zn for the Cuvelai-Etosha Basin. The relative abundance of cations and metals are attributed to the differences in geology of the basins and the extent of water-rock interaction. Our results show that the quality of groundwater in Cuvelai-Etosha Basin and Kuiseb Basin which vary in the extent of aridity, is controlled by the extent of water-rock interaction at the surface and in the groundwater aquifer.

AB Scarcity of sufficient amounts of water of sufficient quality for potable drinking water supply and for industrial and agricultural use is currently one of the most serious worldwide problems. The awareness of this problem has strongly changed the approach how to deal with the treatment of wastewater. In the past the aim of a wastewater treatment process was primarily to produce an effluent that could be discharged on surface water. Traditional microbiological methods in combination with simple mechanical methods were able to produce the effluent quality required for the discharge on surface water. Currently there is an increasing need to achieve a higher quality of the effluent to make beneficial reuse of the treated wastewater possible but also for recovery of valuable products and energy from the wastewater. Because microbiological treatment methods are only to a relatively small part able to satisfy all these needs, the role and significance of physical/chemical treatment steps in wastewater treatment is gaining more and more importance.

TI Spatiotemporal profiling of chemicals of emerging concern in a megacity:

SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
AB Rapid population growth and urbanisation pose risk to the environment and public health. The aim of this study is to undertake a large-scale spatiotemporal chemical profiling of chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) in the rapidly growing megacity of Lagos, Nigeria. A one-week monitoring study was carried out on 63 target compounds at four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and two sewage disposal points (SDPs) which represent different socioeconomic areas in Lagos metropolis. Forty-eight CECs out of 63 monitored were quantified at least once in the influent and effluent samples. Results showed that tramadol and its metabolite O-desmethyltramadol were the highest contributors to the overall CEC concentrations in influent samples. High variability in weekly trends suggests complexity of sample matrix influencing method performance and variability in CECs across sites. High concentrations of target compounds in effluent of WWTP2 and WWTP4 indicate a poor elimination rate. The results from effluent samples from the constructed wetland showed efficient removal of compounds in a natural system. Generally, the concentrations of target analytes in surface water appear to be independent of distance from discharge points. Occurrence of CECs at very high concentrations in effluent samples and the higher concentrations detected upstream of surface water is a cause for concern. The study proposes promoting the use of constructed wetlands in Lagos metropolis for effective removal of CECs and achieves a sustainable and environmentally friendly mode of treatment.

TI Emergy analysis of urban domestic water metabolism: A case study in
   Beijing (China)
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This work elaborated an analysis of urban water metabolic system. The system's flows and processes were modeled and accounted on the basis of the ecosystem cumulative energy availability, also known as emergy. In detail, both the urban domestic water supplying process metabolism model and accounting framework were defined. Then, the whole process of the supplying of domestic water was analyzed, considering Beijing (China) as a case study. In particular, the existing water sources were included: surface water, underground water, water of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project; potential desalinated water from Tianjin. The results showed that, for the supply of 1 m(3) of tap water, the total emergy input from the above-mentioned four sources are 3.22E+12, 3.34E+12, 4.55E+12, and 12.55E+12 sej. These values reflect the different energy costs of the existing supply systems, that are related to water transportation, treatment and distribution, Moreover, the emergy cost of desalinated water is about 4 times higher than the one of surface water. Conversely, the value of South-to-North Water Transfer Project is not much higher than that of surface water. Finally, the higher costs are related to the water treatment phase. Consequently, some policy recommendations and future research directions are identified for improving the sustainability for Beijing domestic water supply. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Integrating mitigation measures for karst rocky desertification land in
   the Southwest mountains of China
SO CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES
AB Karst rocky desertification is a unique landscape phenomenon that causes land degradation. Scientists throughout the world are continuously exploring methods for its management. In the southwest mountain areas in China, karst rocky desertification restricts sustainable ecological and economic development, prompting government and academia to focus on environmental mitigation and elimination of poverty in the area. We performed an in-depth analysis of past mitigation models and techniques in the karst area, considering the low utilization efficiency of surface water resources. On the basis of the hydrogeological features of karst and its development, we propose the following technologies for the efficient use of karst surface water resources: on dolomite slopes, surface runoff was collected from gulley confluences, rainwater was collected from road surfaces, and surface springs were diverted into sunken cisterns. In areas with mixed limestone and dolomite, a pavement rainwater catchment facility can be constructed. The development and utilization of surface water resources in karst mountainous areas should be based on their unique hydrogeological structures, and the appropriate technology or model should be selected. We then undertook a study of comprehensive rocky desertification control technology, which considered the low land productivity in rocky desertification areas. A technical model of rocky desertification mitigation was also formulated. In this model, ecological and industrial benefits improve the technologies and the economy in karst areas. Overall, this study aims to provide research-driven technological solutions to address ecological deterioration, poverty, and economic challenges caused by rocky desertification in mountainous karst areas.

TI The change of nutrient situation in the Prydz Bay waters along longitude
   73 degrees E, Antarctica, in the context of global environmental change
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB The spatial and temporal characteristics of nutrient concentrations and their influencing factors along longitude 73 degrees E in Prydz Bay were explored. Nutrient concentrations gradually increased from the continental shelf to the open ocean in summer surface water, and the stable environment in the bay, the chlorophyll a and the ice melting were responsible for this distribution characteristic. There was also clear annual variation of nutrients in the surface water. Average concentrations of nutrients showed the highest values in 2010, while they were the lowest in 2009, which may be influenced by El Nino. In the vertical distribution, there were close relationships between chlorophyll a PO4-P, SiO3-Si, S, and NO3-N depths respectively. Moreover, the variation of water masses also influenced the distribution of nutrients. Overall, the spatial and temporal characteristics of nutrients were closely related to environmental change, and especially to the ice melting in the Prydz Bay.

TI A synthesis of hydroclimatic, ecological, and socioeconomic data for
   transdisciplinary research in the Mekong
SO SCIENTIFIC DATA
AB The Mekong River basin (MRB) is a transboundary basin that supports livelihoods of over 70 million inhabitants and diverse terrestrial-aquatic ecosystems. This critical lifeline for people and ecosystems is under transformation due to climatic stressors and human activities (e.g., land use change and dam construction). Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand the changing hydrological and ecological systems in the MRB and develop improved adaptation strategies. This, however, is hampered partly by lack of sufficient, reliable, and accessible observational data across the basin. Here, we fill this long-standing gap for MRB by synthesizing climate, hydrological, ecological, and socioeconomic data from various disparate sources. The data- including groundwater records digitized from the literature-provide crucial insights into surface water systems, groundwater dynamics, land use patterns, and socioeconomic changes. The analyses presented also shed light on uncertainties associated with various datasets and the most appropriate choices. These datasets are expected to advance socio-hydrological research and inform science-based management decisions and policymaking for sustainable food-energy-water, livelihood, and ecological systems in the MRB.

TI Ecological environmental effects of Yellow River irrigation revealed by
   isotope and ion hydrochemistry in the Yinchuan Plain, Northwest China
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB Water is the most critical resource that affects the stability of ecosystems and socio-economic development in arid and semi-arid regions. The rational development and utilization of water resources in Yinchuan Plain play a vital role in supporting and leading its ecological environment protection and high-quality agricultural development. Irrigation water from the Yellow River and groundwater are the main water resources of Yinchuan Plain. To understand the ecological impact of the Yellow River irrigation, the research analyzed the interaction between surface water and shallow groundwater using isotope hydrochemical method. The results show that both surface water and shallow groundwater are neutral and alkaline, the hydraulic relationships among the water bodies are strong. The correlation between 17O-excess and delta 18O depends on the proportions of precipitation recharge and the intensity of evaporation. The chemical characteristics of water are controlled by evaporation, irrigation activities and water-rock interactions. Hydrochemical characteristics indicate that Yellow River irrigation has little impact on the Yellow River, but it has caused a rise in the groundwater level, intensified evaporation, and aggravated soil salinization. Isotopes indicate that Water-Saving Transformation Project has brought about a new ecological problem-lake shrinkage while reducing salinization. Therefore, we propose to moderately increase the amount of water diversion to flush the groundwater ions and extract the groundwater for human activities during the irrigation period to reduce salinization and water resource shortage. Salinization should be considered in relation to sustainable agricultural development and ecological environment health in Yinchuan Plain as well as other similar arid regions.

AB Drinking water shortage has become a significant problem in urban areas due to the growth of population and high economic activities. It is known that Shah Alam is the city and the state of Selangor, Malaysia. This city has the most manufacturing sector and services with a huge number of inhabitants. Thus, this urban area needs to have sufficient clean water supply. However, the raw water needs to undergo several water treatments processes before it can safely distribute to the residents. This untreated water from incoming surface waters contains suspended particles that need to go through the water treatment process, and most importantly, the coagulation and flocculation process. Normally, aluminum sulfate (alum) or polymer were added as the coagulant for the treatment of untreated water. However, due to health concerns, natural coagulants have been preferred to replace the conventional method. This natural coagulant is environmentally friendly and has no side effects if being consumed. This research aims to investigate the optimum condition of natural coagulant (Moringa oleifera) for the treatment of surface water from Shah Alam Lakes in Selangor Region, Malaysia. These lakes can be a potential source of water if water shortage occurs. At first, the characteristics of the water samples were determined. Later, the sample of surface water from the lakes was examined with the jar test for the coagulation-flocculation process using Moringa oleifera with different concentrations. The water quality parameters such as pH, turbidity, suspended solids, phosphorus and chemical oxygen demand were evaluated. From the results obtained, Moringa oleifera can be considered as suitable alternatives to replace chemical coagulants for a sustainable water treatment system.

TI Impact of Droughts on Water Supply in US Watersheds: The Role of
   Renewable Surface and Groundwater Resources
SO EARTHS FUTURE
AB We use a simplified water supply system model based on the water availability assessment via the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model to analyze water supply droughts (WSDs), which are periods with deficient water supply. The model is applied to 27 representative watersheds of the contiguous U.S. to explore how different management strategies can be more effective in mitigating WSDs in watersheds with different drought propagation mechanisms. We find that water supply deficits during droughts (WSDDs) are generally the highest in the Great Plains watersheds, followed by the western U.S. watersheds, and lowest in the eastern U.S. watersheds. We show that different measures can be adopted to mitigate WSDs in different regions. Specifically, in the western U.S. watersheds, the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater can reduce WSDD, that is, increasing surface water utilization and using groundwater recharged through winter precipitation to supplement surface water supply during droughts. In the Great Plains region, water demands need to be brought down to sustainable levels; meanwhile switching from groundwater to surface water supply can significantly reduce WSDD as the alluvial aquifers in this region provide a stable baseflow, which can act as a steady source of water supply during droughts. In the eastern U.S. watersheds, the depletion of limited storage capacity during droughts can lead to WSDD for short periods of time, which highlights the need for expansion of storage capacity in this region.

TI Upstream flows drive the productivity of floodplain ecosystems in
   tropical Queensland
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB Rivers in tropical systems across the world are well known for their strong connections with floodplain wetlands. However, increased water needs and changing climate could drive water-management policy that leads to major changes in flow or surface water availability. These changes could have deleterious effects on ecological functions and ecosystem services provided by these freshwater ecosystems (e.g., groundwater recharge, food sources for fish, etc.). In this study, we introduce a cloud-based monitoring framework using multi-resolution satellite observations (2007 -2020), historical surface inundation (1984 -2015), and gauge data to better understand these connections in a large river catchment in tropical Queensland (Mitchell River catchment). A key driver and indicator of floodplain productivity, surface water inundation and aquatic biomass distribution respectively, are investigated to provide insight that underpins the prioritization of future surface water developments in this region. Results show that the characteristics of floodplain inundation; loss, persistence, gain and frequency, vary in time and space, and are driven by climate variability. The largest gain (7200 Ha) and persistence (8437 Ha) in total surface inundation were observed in the wet seasons during the periods of 2007 -2019, respectively. In the downstream catchment, permanent water surface area was approximately 4.5% (of the total downstream region) compared to the upstream region (2.7%). There is a higher proportion of new permanent water features (16.8%) and new seasonal (30%) surface water classes in the upstream are in contrast to the downstream section (0.7% and 9.6%, respectively). Using multivariate statistics, floodplain productivity was linked to inter-annual changes in flow and rainfall. A partial least squares regression (PLSR) model shows upstream flows drive changes in total floodplain inundation (observed vs predicted, r = 0.95, p = 0.000). Flows and local rainfall accounted for approximately 60% (r = 0.77, p = 0.005) and 25% (r = 0.50, p = 0.120) of the variability in total floodplain inundation, respectively. Different PLSR modelling scenarios confirmed that upstream flows are primary drivers of floodplain inundation and substantial lost in total surface inundation could happen if flows are altered. Just as local rainfall has limited impact on total floodplain inundation (r = 0.92, p = 0.000; for model excluding local rainfall), aquatic plant biomass accumulations are also strongly associated with upstream flows (e.g., r = 0.82). Given the dependence of downstream water level (r = 0.89) and floodplain inundation on upstream flows, sustainable management of river flows in the Mitchell River is fundamentally important to floodplain productivity.

TI The transport of beta-hexachlorocyclohexane to the western Arctic Ocean:
   a contrast to alpha-HCH
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB A large database for a-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH), together with multimedia models, shows this chemical to have exhibited classical 'cold condensation' behavior. The surface water of the Arctic Ocean became loaded between 1950 and 1990 because atmospheric transport of alpha-HCH from source regions to the Arctic was rapid and because alpha-HCH partitioned strongly into cold water there. Following emission reductions during the 1980s, alpha-HCH remained trapped under the permanent ice pack, with the result that the highest oceanic concentrations in the early 1990s were to be found in surface waters of the Canada Basin. Despite a much stronger partitioning into water than for alpha-HCH, beta-HCH did not accumulate under the pack ice of the Arctic Ocean, its might be expected from the similar emission histories for the two chemicals. beta-HCH appears to have loaded only weakly into the high Arctic through the atmosphere because it was rained Out or partitioned into North Pacific surface water. However, beta-HCH has subsequently entered the western Arctic in ocean currents passing through Bering Strait. beta-HCH provides an important lesson that environmental pathways must be comprehensively understood before attempting to predict the behavior of one chemical by extrapolation from a seemingly similar chemical.

TI Antibiotics in the Environment as one of the Barriers to Sustainable
   Development
SO PROBLEMY EKOROZWOJU
AB The paper has analyzed the presence of antibiotics in crude (hospital, medicine production and municipal) waste water, treated waste water, surface water and drinking water across the world. The concentrations of antibiotics in medicine production waste water reached a level of up to 900 mu/dm(3); in hospital waste water, up to 124 mu/dm(3); and in municipal waste water, up to 64 mu/dm(3). Antibiotic concentrations in treated waste water approached 260 ng/dm(3). The presence of antibiotics in surface water has also been covered. The most often identified medicines were: Ciprofloxacin, Erythromycin, Norfloxacin, Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim. The maximum antibiotic concentrations in surface water are as high as up to 2 mu g/dm(3). In the majority of cases, identified antibiotics occurred in concentrations from several to several dozen ng/dm(3), and less often in several hundred ng/dm3. The presence of antibiotics in drinking water, similarly as for waste water, was identified worldwide, e.g. in China, USA, Germany, Canada, France. Very high antibiotic concentrations were noted in Guangzhou, China, which reached a level of up to 679.7 ng/dm(3) (Ciprofloxacin), but also in the USA (Triclosan) 734 ng/dm(3)). In the majority of instances, antibiotics are present in water in much lower concentrations. The consequence of environmental contamination with antibiotics is the drug resistance of many bacterial strains with the resultant deaths of 25 000 people in the European Union and 700 000 people across the globe. The other effects of the presence of antibiotics in the natural environment are not fully understood yet. For example, carcinogenic, teratogenic or mutagenic effects are attributed to these contaminants.

AB Latitudinal variations of delta(13)C(org) of plankton, sinking particles and surface sediments of the southern Atlantic Ocean have been compiled and compared to literature-derived [CO2 (aq)] values in surface waters. We observed less variability of the sediment-delta(13)C data at a given latitude compared to the plankton values which more sensitively record seasonal changes. In the tropical-subtropical Atlantic with low seasonality, we measured a relatively small latitudinal variation (-18.5 to -22.5 parts per thousand) of the sediment-delta(13)C. In contrast, a steep gradient of both isotope values and [CO2 (aq)] was found south of 40 degrees S. South of 60 degrees S, the sediment-delta(13)C values were between -23 and -26.5 parts per thousand corresponding to generally higher [CO2 (aq)] values. The surface sediments were generally heavier by 0.5-3.2 parts per thousand in the tropical-subtropical Atlantic and 3.0-4.6 parts per thousand in Southern Ocean, respectively, compared to sinking matter; they were also heavier by up to 3.2 parts per thousand than freshly sedimented phytodetritus sampled in the Southern Ocean. These differences may at least be partly attributed to the anthropogenic PCO2 increase leading to an enhanced effect in the Southern Ocean due to increasing CO, solubility. We estimated the preindustrial [CO2 (aq)] from sediment-delta(13)C(org) to be lower by 1-2 mu mol l(-1) in warm waters and up to 8 mu mol l(-1) in cold waters compared to present day measurements. We found that the isotope values of the surface sediments were generally linked to surface water [CO2 (aq)] (preindustrial), resulting in a relationship rather similar to that derived from plankton data [Rau, G.H., 1994. Variations in sedimentary organic delta(13)C as a proxy for past changes in ocean and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. In: Zahn, R., Pedersen, T.F., Kaminski, M.A., Labeyrie, L. (Eds.), Carbon Cycling in the Glacial Ocean, NATO Asi Series, Global Environmental Change, Vol. 17]. However, estimations of past [CO2 (aq)] from sediment-delta(13)C(org) may have a large uncertainty especially in the Southern Ocean. Here, our data show the weakest correlation, probably due to effects of changing growth rates and productivity, in particular at the frontal zones.

TI Perfluorooctane sulfonate concentrations in surface water in Japan
SO ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
AB Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a class of specialty chemicals used in a variety of applications, and has been found to be globally distributed in many living organisms including humans. Several analytical methods have been developed for determination of PFOS in environmental samples and biological matrices. However, these methods employ liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), an instrumentation which has limited accessibility because it is expensive to use and maintain. In the present study we present the development of a robust analytical method using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) in combination with solid phase extraction. The high yield and concentration of the present method enabled us to quantify PFOS as low as 0.1 ng/L. This method was applied to the determination of PFOS in 142 surface water samples collected from various geographic locations around Japan. The geometric mean (geometric standard deviation) (ng/L) for river samples (n = 126) was 2.37 (4.13), with a median of 1.68 and a range of 0.3-157 ng/L. and for coastal sea water samples (n = 16) was 1.52 (4.14), with a median of 1.21 and a range of 0.2-25.2 ng/L. However. the concentrations in most of the samples were much lower than the values reported in the US, except for those from the Jinzu (135.0 ng/L) and Tama (157 ng/L) Rivers. Because surface waters in the Ara (13.0-38.5 ng/L), Tama (0.7-157.0ng/L), and Yodo (0.9-27.3 ng/L) Rivers, sources of drinking water for more than eight million people, were moderately contaminated with PFOS, more work is needed to assess exposure to PFOS.

TI Airborne Microbes Contribute to N-2 Fixation in Surface Water of the
   Northern Red Sea
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Desert dust storms are frequent in the Northern Red Sea region, providing nutrients (i.e., PO4) and trace-metals (i.e., Fe) that may stimulate dinitrogen (N-2) fixation. Dust also carries a high diversity of airborne microbes (bacteria and archaea), including diazotrophs, that may remain viable during transport and upon deposition. Here we evaluate the impact of atmospheric deposition and its associated airborne diazotrophs on N-2 fixation in the surface water of the low-nutrient Northern Red Sea, using mesocosm bioassay experiments. We compared the chemical (nutritional) and sole airborne microbial impact of aerosol additions on N-2 fixation using live-dust (release nutrients/trace metals and viable airborne microorganisms) and UV-killed dust (release only chemicals). Airborne diazotrophy accounted for about one third of the measured N-2 fixation (0.350.06nmolNL(-1)day(-1) and 0.290.06nmolNL(-1)day(-1), for February 2017 and May 2017, live-dust additions, respectively). Two nifH sequences related to cluster III diazotrophs were amplified from the dust samples, consistent with the N-2 fixation measurement results. We postulate that the deposition of viable airborne diazotrophs may enhance N-2 fixation, especially in marine provinces subjected to high aerosol loads. We speculate that the relative contribution of airborne N-2 fixation may increase in the future with the predicted increase in dust deposition.
   Plain Language Summary Aerosols and dust are regularly transported across the oceans supplying nutrients and trace metals to the surface water. In addition, aerosols may also contain a wide array of different airborne microorganisms (heterotrophic bacteria, virus, cyanobacteria, and fungi) that can be easily transported for thousands of kilometers away from their place of origin within a few days. Here we examined the role of airborne N-2 fixers (diazotrophs) in the surface water of the low-nutrient Northern Red Sea during the summer. To this end, we compared the chemical (nutritional) and sole airborne microbial impact of aerosol additions on N-2 fixation using live-dust (release nutrients/trace metals and viable airborne microorganisms) and UV-killed dust (release only chemicals). Our results demonstrate that airborne N-2 fixation may be an important source of new bioavailable N in the Northern Red Sea, fueling primary production. In accordance with these measurements, two nifH sequences related to cluster III diazotrophs were amplified from the dust samples. Our results suggest that airborne N-2 fixation may play an important role in marine environments subjected to high aerosol loads. We further suggest that the role of airborne diazotrophs may likely increase in the future due to global desertification processes and thus an increase in dust deposition.

TI Simultaneous Occurrence of Psychotropic Pharmaceuticals in Surface Water
   of the Megacity Shanghai and Implication for Their Ecotoxicological
   Risks
SO ACS ES&T WATER
AB Psychotropic pharmaceuticals account for a large proportion of the most prescribed drugs globally. They cannot be completely removed in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which raise a concern about their occurrence and ecotoxicology in the aquatic system. In the present study, we developed a sensitive and reliable method and analyzed 34 psychotropic pharmaceuticals in river water of the megacity Shanghai. The impacts of WWTPs on the contamination of psychoactive drugs were also evaluated by comparing the river water samples collected from upstream and downstream of WWTPs. Among the target substances, 29 drugs were detected in the water samples with the concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 260 ng/L, and the occurrence of five of them in river water was reported for the first time. Many psychotropic pharmaceuticals occurred in river water simultaneously with the total concentration up to 480 ng/L. The spatial distribution of psychotropic pharmaceuticals and the ratio between venlafaxine and its metabolite indicated the contamination of psychotropic pharmaceuticals was higher in populated areas but municipal WWTPs had little impact on their contaminations in the urban river of Shanghai, suggesting other important emission sources other than domestic wastewater exist. Exposure of zebrafish embryos further demonstrated multiple developmental effects caused by several of the most detected substances and, especially, by their mixtures and highlighted their interference with the neural development of zebrafish. Thus, our results provide novel insights into the understanding of the occurrence of psychotropic pharmaceuticals in surface waters and their ecotoxicological risks to aquatic organisms.

AB With modules developed in an informatics package for geographic information systems (GIS), the present work calculates the emergy of groundwater and the inter-annual variation in emergy of surface water resources in basins that encompass the metropolitan areas of Toluca and Monterrey, Mexico; that is, Upper Course of the Lerma River (UCLR) and the Santa Catarina River (SCR) basin, respectively. In addition, a criterion has been found to identify the intensive exploitation of aquifers. This allows for considering those volumes as non-renewable resources, when applicable, in processes to define integrated water resources management. The transformity weighted mean of water resources due to chemical potential energy in the SCR basin (9.32E + 06 sej/J for surface water and 6.47E + 06 sej/J for groundwater) was greater than in the UCLR basin (5.75E + 05 sej/J for surface water and 2.83E + 05 sej/J for groundwater). Nevertheless, based on the analysis of the variation in emergy, some strategies were identified to improve the efficiency of the joint management of water resources. Standing out among these is the determination of a monthly variability in the volumes of water provided, making it possible to observe a decrease in emergy per unit volume in the SCR basin and an increase in the percentage of renewable resources in the UCLR basin.

TI Will groundwater ease freshwater stress under climate change?

CY JUN 24-28, 2008
CL Kampala, UGANDA
SP Minist Water & Environ, Univ Coll London
AB Today, groundwater is the source of about one third of global water withdrawals and provides drinking water for a large portion of the global population. In many regions it is subject to stress with respect to both quantity and quality. Hence, it is of utmost importance to improve our knowledge about the impacts of climate change on groundwater. Climate change will affect groundwater recharge, i.e. long-term average renewable groundwater resources, via increases in mean temperature, precipitation variability and sea level, as well as via changes in mean precipitation (increasing in some areas and decreasing in others). Over many areas groundwater recharge is projected to increase in the warming world (though less than river runoff), but many semi-arid areas that suffer from water stress already may face decreased groundwater recharge. The sea level rise that is likely to occur during the 21st century might leave many flat coral islands without a reliable groundwater source. However, in coastal areas with a land surface elevation of a few metres or more, groundwater availability is more strongly impacted by changes in groundwater recharge than sea-level rise. Under climate change, reliable surface water supply is likely to decrease due to increased temporal variations of river flow that are caused by increased precipitation variability and decreased snow/ice storage. Under these circumstances, it might be beneficial to take advantage of the storage capacity of groundwater and increase groundwater withdrawals. However, this option is only sustainable where groundwater withdrawals remain well below groundwater recharge. Groundwater is not likely to ease freshwater stress in those areas where climate change is projected to decrease groundwater recharge (e.g. Northeast Brazil and the Mediterranean basin).

TI A Review of Earth Observation-Based Analyses for Major River Basins
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Regardless of political boundaries, river basins are a functional unit of the Earth's land surface and provide an abundance of resources for the environment and humans. They supply livelihoods supported by the typical characteristics of large river basins, such as the provision of freshwater, irrigation water, and transport opportunities. At the same time, they are impacted i.e., by human-induced environmental changes, boundary conflicts, and upstream-downstream inequalities. In the framework of water resource management, monitoring of river basins is therefore of high importance, in particular for researchers, stake-holders and decision-makers. However, land surface and surface water properties of many major river basins remain largely unmonitored at basin scale. Several inventories exist, yet consistent spatial databases describing the status of major river basins at global scale are lacking. Here, Earth observation (EO) is a potential source of spatial information providing large-scale data on the status of land surface properties. This review provides a comprehensive overview of existing research articles analyzing major river basins primarily using EO. Furthermore, this review proposes to exploit EO data together with relevant open global-scale geodata to establish a database and to enable consistent spatial analyses and evaluate past and current states of major river basins.

TI Seasonally Variant Stable Isotope Baseline Characterisation of Malawi's
   Shire River Basin to Support Integrated Water Resources Management
SO WATER
AB Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) is vital to the future of Malawi and motivates this study's provision of the first stable isotope baseline characterization of the Shire River Basin (SRB). The SRB drains much of Southern Malawi and receives the sole outflow of Lake Malawi whose catchment extends over much of Central and Northern Malawi (and Tanzania and Mozambique). Stable isotope (283) and hydrochemical (150) samples were collected in 2017-2018 and analysed at Malawi's recently commissioned National Isotopes Laboratory. Distinct surface water dry-season isotope enrichment and wet-season depletion are shown with minor retention of enriched signatures ascribed to Lake Malawi influences. Isotopic signatures corroborate that wet-season river flows mostly arise from local precipitation, with dry-season flows supported by increased groundwater contributions. Groundwater signatures follow a local meteoric water line of limited spread suggesting recharge by local precipitation predominantly during the peak months of the wet-season. Relatively few dry-season groundwater samples displayed evaporative enrichment, although isotopic seasonality was more pronounced in the lowlands compared to uplands ascribed to amplified climatic effects. These signatures serve as isotopic diagnostic tools that valuably informed a basin conceptual model build and, going forward, may inform key identified Malawian IWRM concerns. The isotopic baseline establishes a benchmark against which future influences from land use, climate change and water mixing often inherent to IWRM schemes may be forensically assessed. It thereby enables both source-water protection and achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 6.

TI Analysis of small microplastics in coastal surface water samples of the
   subtropical island of Okinawa, Japan
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Marine plastic debris is widely recognized as a global environmental issue. Small microplastic particles, with an upper size limit of 20 mu m, have been identified as having the highest potential for causing damage to marine ecosystems. Having accurate methods for quantifying the abundance of such particles in a natural environment is essential for defining the extent of the problem they pose. Using an optical micro-Raman tweezers setup, we have identified the composition of particles trapped in marine aggregates collected from the coastal surface waters around the subtropical island of Okinawa. Chemical composition analysis at the single-particle level indicates dominance by low-density polyethylene, which accounted for 75% of the small microplastics analysed. The smallest microplastics identified were (2.53 +/- 0.85) mu m polystyrene. Our results show the occurrence of plastics at all test sites, with the highest concentration in areas with high human activities. We also observed additional Raman peaks on the plastics spectrum with decreasing debris size which could be related to structural modification due to weathering or embedding in organic matter. By identifying small microplastics at the single-particle level, we obtain some indication on their dispersion in the ocean which could be useful for future studies on their potential impact on marine biodiversity.

TI Ecological assessments of surface water bodies at the river basin level:
   a case study from England
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB Ecological assessments of surface water bodies are essential in order to evaluate the level of degradation in freshwater ecosystems and to address the subsequent decline in services they provide. These assessments cover multiple aspects of the aquatic environment, particularly biological elements due to their ability to respond to all pressures within an ecosystem. Such assessments can enable the identification of the multiple pressures which threaten water bodies, facilitating sustainable decisions regarding their management to be identified. Here, the design requirements of the networks which facilitate ecological assessments are presented. A river basin district in England is used as a case study to investigate the number of elements monitored, the number of failing elements and the relationship between failing elements. Findings demonstrate the value of ensuring that monitoring networks are risk based and appropriately designed to meet their objectives. This therefore requires that monitoring is not only for the communicating of compliance but also for use iteratively so that the design of monitoring networks and ultimately management can be continually improved.

TI An empirical test of groundwater pumping effects on river flow and
   temperature: Chemainus River case study
SO CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL
AB Groundwater abstraction from pumping wells can reduce the flows and water levels of hydraulically connected surface waters, which can affect aquatic communities and water rights of other users. Four pump tests were implemented in the 2016 summer low-flow period to measure groundwater pumping effects to Chemainus River surface water flow and temperature. The effect of pumping on surface flow was estimated using four metrics based on differences between measured and predicted flow at a hydrometric gauge located 340 m from the groundwater wells. Differences were estimated as residuals from a regression model relating flow at this gauge to flow at a gauge 1.3 km upstream of the wells. The effect of pumping on surface water temperature was assessed using daily maximum and daily average water temperature at gauges located 340 m and 1.4 km downstream of the wells. An effect of pumping on river flow was measurable when the pumps were turned on and shut off. The consistency of measured effects across all tests and the absence of discernable trends within and across tests indicate that the average effect of pumping across a broader period is equivalent to the average of all before and after comparisons, which was estimated as 9.9 L/s +/- 12.1 L/s, or 5.5% of river discharge at the time of the tests. Groundwater pumping did not result in a detectable shift in water temperature. The results indicate that changes in water temperature in relation to the pump tests were smaller in magnitude or spatial scale than the detection limits of the implemented experimental design. This case study provides an example of quantification of pumping effects on stream flow and temperature, as required by the Water Sustainability Act for licensing of groundwater abstraction. We suggest this approach could be used elsewhere to quantify effects of groundwater abstraction.

AB Polar regions are extremely sensitive to pollution such as harmful gases, particles or toxic substances which affect the Arctic climate and ecosystems. Spitsbergen, as well as all Arctic region, because of its geographically distant location and lack of industry sector, should be free of chemical pollution. Despite this, many pollutants could be found in the Polar environment, for example in freshwaters. Their occurrence is related with the global distillation process (Grasshopper effect) in which the contaminants from lower latitudes are transferred to the higher latitudes, resulting in the pollution of Arctic area.
   The purpose of the research was to determine the selected parameters: TOC (Total Organic Carbon) and formaldehyde, phenols in samples of freshwaterwater (surface water) collected in the area surrounding the capital of Spitsbergen (Longyearbyen). The aim was to investigate the pollution of Arctic freshwater. The obtained results of detected compounds may confirm the role of transport of contaminants over large distances in pollution of Polar regions.

TI Insight into anthropogenic forcing on coastal upwelling off
   south-central Chile
SO ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
AB Coastal upwelling systems off the coasts of Peru and Chile are among the most productive marine ecosystems in the world, sustaining a significant percentage of global primary production and fishery yields. Seasonal and interannual variability in these systems has been relatively well documented; however, an understanding of recent trends and the influence of climate change on marine processes such as surface cooling and primary productivity is limited. This study presents evidence that winds favorable to upwelling have increased within the southern boundary of the Humboldt Current System (35 degrees-42 degrees S) in recent decades. This trend is consistent with a poleward movement of the influence of the Southeast Pacific Anticyclone and resembles the spatial pattern projected by Global Circulation Models for warming scenarios. Chlorophyll a levels (from 2002 to present) determined by satellite and field-based time-series observations show a positive trend, mainly in austral spring-summer (December-January-February), potentially explained by observed increments in nutrient flux towards surface waters and photosynthetically active radiation. Both parameters appear to respond to alongshore wind stress and cloud cover in the latitudinal range of 35 degrees S to 42 degrees S. In addition, net annual deepening of the mixed layer depth is estimated using density and temperature profiles. Changes in this depth are associated with increasing winds and may explain cooler, more saline, and more productive surface waters, with the latter potentially causing fluctuations in dissolved oxygen and other gases, such as nitrous oxide, sensitive to changes in oxygenation. We argue that these recent changes represent, at least in part, a regional manifestation of the Anthropocene along the Chilean coast.

TI Quantifying phosphorus levels in soils, plants, surface water, and
   shallow groundwater associated with bahiagrass-based pastures
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Recent assessments of water quality status have identified eutrophication as one of the major causes of water quality 'impairment' not only in the USA but also around the world. In most cases, eutrophication has accelerated by increased inputs of phosphorus due to intensification of crop and animal production systems since the early 1990s. Despite substantial measurements using both laboratory and field techniques, little is known about the spatial and temporal variability of phosphorus dynamics across landscapes, especially in agricultural landscapes with cow-calf operations. Critical to determining environmental balance and accountability is an understanding of phosphorus excreted by animals, phosphorus removal by plants, acceptable losses of phosphorus within the manure management and crop production systems into soil and waters, and export of phosphorus off-farm. Further research effort on optimizing forage-based cow-calf operations to improve pasture sustainability and protect water quality is therefore warranted. We hypothesized that properly managed cow-calf operations in subtropical agroecosystem would not be major contributors to excess loads of phosphorus in surface and ground water. To verify our hypothesis, we examined the comparative concentrations of total phosphorus among soils, forage, surface water, and groundwater beneath bahiagrass-based pastures with cow-calf operations in central Florida, USA.
   Soil samples were collected at 0-20; 20-40, 40-60, and 60-100 cm across the landscape (top slope, middle slope, and bottom slope) of 8 ha pasture in the fall and spring of 2004 to 2006. Forage availability and phosphorus uptake of bahiagrass were also measured from the top slope, middle slope, and bottom slope. Bi-weekly (2004-2006) groundwater and surface water samples were taken from wells located at top slope, middle slope, and bottom slope, and from the runoff/seepage area. Concentrations of phosphorus in soils, forage, surface water, and shallow groundwater beneath a bahiagrass-based pasture and forage availability at four different landscape positions and soil depth (for soil samples only) in 2004, 2005, and 2006 were analyzed statistically following a two-way analysis of variance using the SAS PROC general linear models model. Where the F-test indicated a significant (p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.05) effect, means were separated following the method of Duncan multiple range test using the appropriate error mean squares.
   Concentrations of soil total phosphorus and degree of phosphorus saturation varied significantly (p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.001) with landscape position and sampling depth, but there was no interaction effect of landscape position and sampling depth. Overall, there was slight buildup of soil total phosphorus. There was no movement of total phosphorus into the soil pedon since average degree of phosphorus saturation in the upper 20 cm was 21% while degree of phosphorus saturation at 60-100 cm was about 3%. Our livestock operations contributed negligible concentrations of phosphorus to groundwater (0.67 mg L-1) and surface water (0.55 mg L-1). The greatest forage mass of 6,842 kg ha(-1) and the greatest phosphorus uptake of 20.4 kg P ha(-1) were observed at the top slope in 2005. Both forage availability and phosphorus uptake of bahiagrass at the bottom slope were consistently the lowest when averaged across landscape position and years. These results can be attributed to the grazing patterns as animals tend to graze more and leave more excretions at the bottom slope. This behavior may lead to an increase in the concentration of soil phosphorus. Effective use and cycling of phosphorus is critical for pasture productivity and environmental stability. Phosphorus cycling in pastures is complex and interrelated, and pasture management practices can influence the interactions and transformations occurring within the phosphorus cycle.
   Our results indicate that current pasture management systems which include cattle rotation in terms of grazing days and current fertilizer application (inorganic + manures + urine) for bahiagrass pastures in subtropical climates on loamy sand soils offer little potential for negatively impacting the environment. Properly managed livestock operations contribute negligible loads of phosphorus to shallow groundwater and surface water. Overall, there was no buildup of soil total phosphorus in bahiagrass-based pasture. Therefore, results of this study may help to renew the focus on improving inorganic fertilizer efficiency in subtropical beef cattle systems and maintaining a balance of phosphorus removed to phosphorus added to ensure healthy forage growth and minimize phosphorus runoff.
   Research on the pathways and rates of movement of phosphorus deposited in urine and dung through various pools and back to the plants will be the focal point of our future investigations. Further studies are needed to determine whether the environmental and ecological implications of grazing and haying in forage-based pastures are satisfied over the longer term. New knowledge based on the whole-farm approach is desirable to identify pastureland at risk of degradation and to prescribe treatments or management practices needed to protect the natural resources while maintaining an economically and environmentally viable operation.

TI The Design, Construction and Maintenance of a SuDS management Train to

   Camp, Ninewah Governate, Kurdistan Region of Iraq
SO JOURNAL OF REFUGEE STUDIES
AB Refugee camps are set up under crisis conditions in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) with Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) installed as a matter of course. However, in general, little account is taken of surface-water drainage or greywater management until the camp floods or greywater streams become an environmental or health issue. This article reports on the construction of a sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) management train in a refugee camp with the community and local non-governmental organizations to address excess surface water and lack of greywater management in this most challenging of environments. There is thus potential to influence policy, at the first stages of planning, to encourage the installation of drainage as well as WASH. SuDS mimic nature by percolating water into the ground, storing it and allowing slow conveyance to reduce the storm peak, improve water quality and provide space for amenity for residents and for biodiversity. By encouraging the water to infiltrate, polluted standing water between dwellings and on the street is reduced, so that human and environmental health is improved, with the potential to address nuisance-insect-breeding sites. Site walkovers, workshops and meetings engaged residents in the design process from the very beginning The design produced by the community was professionally drawn up and passed to the UNHCR and local management engineers for comment and approval; this article describes the process of designing and constructing the first SuDS-management train to be built in a humanitarian setting.

TI Long-term rainfall regression surfaces for the Kruger National Park,
   South Africa: a spatio-temporal review of patterns from 1981 to 2015
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
AB As an important bottom-up driver of ecosystem processes, rainfall is intrinsically linked to the dynamics of vegetation and species distributions through its effects on soil moisture content and surface water availability. Rainfall effects are thus spatially and temporally specific to different environmental role-players. Knowledge of its spatio-temporal pattern is therefore essential to understanding natural ecosystem flux and potential climate change effects. Climate change poses a serious threat to protected areas in particular, as they are often isolated in fragmented landscapes and confined within hard park boundaries. In consequence, a species' natural movement response to resulting climate-induced niche shifts is often obstructed. Long-term, accurate and consistent climate monitoring data are therefore important resources for managers in large protected areas like the Kruger National Park (Kruger). In this article we model local rainfall measurements as a function of global rainfall surfaces, elevation and distance to the ocean using a generalized additive mixed effects model to produce fine-scale (1 km(2)) monthly rainfall surfaces from July 1981 to June 2015. Results show a clear seasonal cycle nested within an oscillating multi-decadal trend. Most noticeably, seasonality is shifting both temporally and spatially as rainfall moves outside of the typical dry/wet periods and areas. In addition, high-rainfall seasons are generally receiving more rainfall while low-rainfall seasons are receiving less. Northwestern regions of the park are experiencing more extreme annual rainfall differences, while far northern and southern regions show greater seasonality changes. The well-described north-south and east-west rainfall gradient is still visible but the spatial complexity of this pattern is more pronounced than expected. Taken together, we show that Kruger's spatio-temporal rainfall patterns are changing significantly in the short to medium term. The resulting raster data set is made freely available to promote holistic ecosystem studies and support longer-term climate change research.

TI Effects of Temperature and Light on Methane Production of Widespread
   Marine Phytoplankton
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB Methane (CH4) production in the ocean surface mixed layer is a widespread but still largely unexplained phenomenon. In this context marine algae have recently been described as a possible source of CH(4)in surface waters. In the present study we investigated the effects of temperature and light intensity (including daylength) on CH(4)formation from three widespread marine algal speciesEmiliania huxleyi,Phaeocystis globosa,andChrysochromulinasp. Rates ofE. huxleyiincreased by 210% when temperature increased in a range from 10 degrees C to 21.5 degrees C, while a further increase in temperature (up to 23.8 degrees C) showed reduction of CH(4)production rates. Our results clearly showed that CH(4)formation ofE. huxleyiis controlled by light: When light intensity increased from 30 to 2,670 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), CH(4)emission rates increased continuously by almost 1 order of magnitude and was more than 1 order of magnitude higher when the daylength (light period) was extended from 6/18 hr light-dark cycle to continuous light. Furthermore, light intensity is also an important factor controlling CH(4)emissions ofChrysochromulinasp. andP. globosaand could therefore be a species-independent regulator of phytoplankton CH(4)production. Based on our results, we might conclude that extensive blooms ofE. huxleyicould act as a main regional source of CH(4)in surface water, since blooming ofE. huxleyiis related to the seasonal increase in both light and temperature, which also stimulate CH(4)production. Under typical global change scenarios,E. huxleyiwill increase its CH(4)production in the future.
   Plain Language Summary Methane is a gas that affects the Earth's climate and is typically produced by microbes in the absence of oxygen or through geological processes. Surprisingly, methane is also produced in oceanic surface waters that are well oxygenated, known as the ocean-methane paradox. Marine phytoplankton has recently been discovered as a methane source, which might help to explain the paradox. Environmental factors such as light and temperature might be important for controlling methane production from marine algae. In order to understand how environmental factors affect methane formation from phytoplankton, we performed several experiments under laboratory conditions. We find that temperature, light intensity, and day length strongly control methane production of phytoplankton. The field blooms of marine algae, which are often strongly related to the seasonal increase of light and temperature, could act as an important regional source of methane in oceanic surface waters. Under typical global change scenarios, marine algae might increase their methane production in the 21th century.

TI The Individual and Synergistic Indexes for Assessments of Heavy Metal
   Contamination in Global Rivers and Risk: a Review
SO CURRENT POLLUTION REPORTS
AB This article provides an overview of heavy metal contamination in rivers and assessment methods of their contamination and effects. According to literature, rivers with heavy metal contamination in surface water are mainly found in developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean area, while rivers with heavy metal contamination in sediments are mostly found in Europe. The increase in heavy metal contamination in rivers has led to the adoption of individual and synergistic assessment methods. Individual methods are useful in assessing the contamination and effects for a single heavy metal, while synergistic methods assess the combined contamination and effects of several heavy metals present in surface water and sediments. These two approaches have been commonly used together in recent studies to overcome the limitations of each other and provide a more comprehensive assessment. The developments, equations, advantages, limitations, and future perspectives of these methods are discussed in this review. Calculating indexes are simple, easy-to-implement, and effective methods to provide early alerts for the environmental changes and the adverse impacts on ecosystems and human health. However, calculating indexes still have limitations due to the lack of background concentrations of heavy metals in the study area. Therefore, this issue should be addressed to overcome the limitations of these methods in the future. This review provides a useful reference for future studies on heavy metal contamination in global rivers and the assessment methods for heavy metal contamination and effects.

TI Distribution of Metal Species and the Assessment Their Bioavailability
   in the Surface Waters of the Arctic: Proposals for the Water Quality
   Standards
SO GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL
AB The paper deals with the vulnerability of surface waters in the Arctic to regional and global base-metal pollution fluxes, a problem whose solution requires specialized approaches to water quality assessment. The metals are shown to be contained in low-salinity waters of the northern territories mostly in ionic forms, which predetermines the high bioavailability of these metals for aquatic life. A model for calculating the ionic species of metals was developed on the basis of mathematical modeling of chemical reactions in natural waters. For 22 aquatic areas in the Kola Peninsula, concentrations of metals (Hg, Cd, Pb, Ni, Cu, Al, and Sr) and their speciation in the waters were calculated. The accumulation of metals in organs and tissues of the fish (as exemplified by whitefish) was studied at the same sites. The biogeochemical activity of metals was demonstrated to determine, first of all, the ratio of labile and nonlabile metal species in the water. The bioavailability of metal species was estimated depending on the geochemical parameters of the aquatic environment and the in-situ speciation of the metals, based on the results of original studies of local lakes. The relationships between the contents of metals in the fish and the content of metal species in the water are clarified using methods of multidimensional scaling and the RDA technology. Values are proposed for the maximum permissible concentrations (MPC) of metals with regard to their high bioavailability in northern low-salinity waters.

TI Minimising surface water pollution resulting from farm-dairy effluent
   application to mole-pipe drained soils. I. An evaluation of the deferred
   irrigation system for sustainable land treatment in the Manawatu
SO NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
AB There is little information available on the magnitude of nutrient losses to surface water from the two-pond and daily irrigation treatment systems for farm-dairy effluent (FDE). A research site has been established on a mole-pipe drained Tokomaru silt loam at Massey University's No. 4 Dairy Farm (475 cows) to investigate some of these issues. The site consists of four plots (40 x 40 m) that have been instrumented to allow the continuous monitoring of drainage and surface runoff. The research was conducted over three lactation seasons (2000/01-2002/03). Based on data collected at the study farm it was calculated that in the past 1500 kg N yr(-1) and 250 kg P yr(-1) were potentially discharged from the two-pond system directly to a stream. A simulation exercise suggests that approximately 108 kg N yr(-1) and 18 kg P yr(-1) would be lost to surface waters if daily irrigation was practised at the farm. The problems of daily irrigation, particularly those related to surface runoff, were further quantified in an experiment in which a single 25-mm FDE irrigation was applied to a soil near field capacity. Approximately 40% of the applied effluent left the soil profile as mole and pipe drainage and 30% as surface runoff. These losses equated to 12 kg N ha(-1) and 2 kg P ha(-1). To minimise nutrient losses from land application of FDE, a system called "deferred irrigation" was designed. Deferred irrigation involves storing effluent in a two-pond treatment system and then applying it strategically when there is a suitable soil water deficit, i.e., the irrigation volume does not exceed the potential soil-water storage. The evaluation of deferred irrigation over three lactation seasons showed that direct losses of nutrients to surface waters were almost eliminated and resulted in the drainage of only approximately 1% of the total effluent nutrients applied. The successful adoption of the deferred irrigation system would require only the capability to store effluent and model or measure soil moisture status within the active root zone.

TI Large-scale climatic effects on traditional Hawaiian fishpond
   aquaculture
SO PLOS ONE
AB Aquaculture accounts for almost one-half of global fish consumption. Understanding the regional impact of climate fluctuations on aquaculture production thus is critical for the sustainability of this crucial food resource. The objective of this work was to understand the role of climate fluctuations and climate change in subtropical coastal estuarine environments within the context of aquaculture practices in He. eia Fishpond, O. ahu Island, Hawai'i. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study of climate effects on traditional aquaculture systems in the Hawaiian Islands. Data from adjacent weather stations were analyzed together with in situ water quality instrument deployments spanning a 12-year period (November 2004 - November 2016). We found correlations between two periods with extremely high fish mortality at He. eia Fishpond (May and October 2009) and slackening trade winds in the week preceding each mortality event, as well as surface water temperatures elevated 2-3 degrees C higher than the background periods (March-December 2009). We posit that the lack of trade wind-driven surface water mixing enhanced surface heating and stratification of the water column, leading to hypoxic conditions and stress on fish populations, which had limited ability to move within net pen enclosures. Elevated water temperature and interruption of trade winds previously have been linked to the onset of El Nio in Hawai'i. Our results provide empirical evidence regarding El Nico effects on the coastal ocean, which can inform resource management efforts about potential impact of climate variation on aquaculture production. Finally, we provide recommendations for reducing the impact of warming events on fishponds, as these events are predicted to increase in magnitude and frequency as a consequence of global warming.

AB The Albuquerque metropolitan area is part of the rapidly growing "sunbelt" region of the southwestern United States and is undergoing rapid development, The municipal, industrial, and residential water needs of the entire population are currently met by groundwater, while agricultural needs within the basin are met by surface water diverted from the Rio Grande. While the city is blessed with an extremely productive aquifer, current metropolitan area groundwater extractions far exceed the sustainable yield of the aquifer. Continued drawdown will lead to greater pumping costs, ground subsidence, and eventual aquifer depletion. At the same time, industrial and non-point-source contamination and naturally occurring arsenic levels are raising concerns about groundwater quality. The City, in cooperation with local, state, and federal agencies, has explored a variety of conjunctive use proposals, all designed to permit the City to use its surface water more directly.

TI Sustainable water access and willingness of smallholder irrigators to
   pay for on-farm water storage systems in Tsavo sub-catchment, Kenya
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB On-farm surface water storage systems can supplement irrigation needs and relieve pressure on surface streams. Using choice experiments, this study assessed farmer' preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for the different attributes of on-farm water storage systems: all year water availability for irrigation, reduction of water resource conflicts and improved water quality. Results show that if smallholder irrigators could be assured of all year water availability, they would be willing to pay US$ 1459.90 per household per hectare. Similarly, a reduction in water resource conflicts attracted a marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) of US$ 1470.20 per household, while improved water quality for domestic use and ecosystems had a MWTP of US$ 870.20. High preferences and WTP for these attributes suggest that policies geared towards addressing water resource conflicts and uncertainty of irrigation water supply need to incorporate on-farm surface water storage systems.

SO SCIENTIFIC STUDY AND RESEARCH-CHEMISTRY AND CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
   BIOTECHNOLOGY FOOD INDUSTRY
AB The current study is focusing on the evaluation of the quality of surface water from the Siret hydrographic basin. For this purpose, was used the Global Pollution Index (I*(GP)), which was calculated for eleven water sampling points from Siret Basin. The sampling was performed for a period between the years 2010 and 2014. In the study were considered the following physicochemical parameters: pH, dissolved oxygen, chemical and biochemical oxygen demand, nitrogen compounds, phosphorus, iron, manganese, cadmium, mercury, nickel, lead, copper, zinc, and chromium. A specific quality index was calculated by considering the provisions of the law and an evaluation score was determined for each of the monitored water parameters. Finally, the global pollution indexes were determined, and based on these values could be evaluated the water pollution state. The results show that the situations when the pollution is creating discomfort effects on the environment are below 20 % (18 %), while the situations when is observed distress on some life forms are around 2 % (based on 474 collecting days, during the studied period).

TI Prioritization of surface water distribution in irrigation districts to
   mitigate crop yield reduction during water scarcity
SO AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB The vulnerability of conventional operational systems in agricultural water distribution systems becomes controversial under successive water shortages. Accordingly, inadequate, unfair, and unreliable surface water distribution has led to crop yield reduction and economic damage. To address these issues, a novel configuration of an automated operating system was developed to mitigate crop yield reductions during times of water scarcity. Using centralized model predictive control (CMPC), an automatedwater distribution control system was devel-oped in MATLAB version (2018a) and integrated with the Aquacrop model to provide an intelligent daily water distribution prioritization within irrigation districts. This study also investigated technical and environmental perspectives in enriching the resilience of agricultural water distribution systems influenced by the water shortage periods. A controversial irrigation district located in central Iran was selected as the test case located in a basin where reported socio-economic and environmental concerns are among the highest in Iran. Application of the developed configuration of the CMPC led to 4.1%, 5.7%, 5.6%, and 7.3%, increasing the crop yield under the water shortage scenarios of 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30%, respectively. Likewise, employing the intelligent oper-ation led to the economic benefit of 8.5, 11.3, 11.9, and 16.8 M US$ by conserving crop production of 3841.4, 5104.8, 5367.6, and 7543.0 tons, respectively, under the scenarios as mentioned above. The proposed method enables water authorities to promote the surface water distribution system in practical, implementable, and step -by-step planning to increase individual and public profits and environmental achievements by reducing water extraction from tube-wells based on the actual water demand potential.

TI Spatial variability and size structure of particles and plankton in the
   Fram Strait
SO PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Changes within marine pelagic fields in the Arctic affect global biogeochemical cycles. The size structure and distribution of particles and plankton (P&P) were studied in the main northward passage of Atlantic water to the Arctic region, which is affected in various ways by climate change. The wide size spectrum of P&P (3 mu m-5 mm) was assessed by combining measurements from two complementary optical counters, a Laser In-Situ Scattering and Transmissometry (LISST) instrument and a Laser Optical Plankton Counter (LOPC). The measurements were performed in the upper 100 m layer at 55 stations in summer in 2013. The P&P were attributed to various functional groups - particles, phytoplankton, marine snow, and zooplankton to test their spatial coupling with hydrodynamic forcing. Although our study confirms that the Fram Strait is a region of strong biophysical contrasts, the expected coastal-offshore gradient has not been distinguished clearly. Three mechanisms could explain P&P patches: particle flocculation due to contact with fresh waters from ice and fjords, enhanced production due to coastal upwelling as well as widening the range of warm surface water advection northwards. Particularly rich biological hot spots were recognised in the northern, shallow parts of the west Spitsbergen shelf, and near the marginal ice edges, confirming that these areas are highly vulnerable to marine predators. Moreover, combining optical measurements from two size-specific optical counters contributes greatly to reducing the substantial knowledge gap regarding wide size structure and distribution of thus far neglected seawater components, such as non-living particles and marine snow aggregates, occurring in this vulnerable Arctic region.

AB Many sensors are suitable for accurate delineation of open water extent, but in vegetated environments, the vegetation canopy can obscure the presence of standing water from detection. Detecting inundation extent in these vegetated environments is especially critical for identifying flooding extent where surface water may exceed flood boundaries and extend into forests surrounding nearby lakes and streams. Regular and timely observations of water surfaces by optical sensors can be impeded by both cloud cover and by vegetation. Here, two microwave techniques for identifying inundation extent will be investigated and compared: L-band global navigation satellite systems reflectometry (GNSS-R) and L- and C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR); and will confirm that there are correspondences between metrics derived from GNSS reflected signals and L-band SAR to inundated area, including wetlands covered by vegetation.

TI Distribution and Sources of Dissolved Black Carbonin Surface Waters of
   the Chukchi Sea, Bering Sea, and the North Pacific Ocean
SO FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
AB Pyrogenic carbon, also called black carbon (BC), is an important component in the global carbon cycle. BC produced by biomass burning or fossil fuel combustion is transported to oceans by the atmosphere or rivers. However, environmental dynamics (i.e., major sources and sinks) of BC in marine environments have not been well-documented. In this study, dissolved BC (DBC) collected from surface waters of the Chukchi Sea, the Bering Sea, and the subarctic and subtropical North Pacific were analyzed using the benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) method. The DBC concentration and the ratio of B5CA and B6CA to all BPCAs (an index of the DBC condensation degree) ranged from 4.8 to 15.5 mu g-C L-1 and from 0.20 to 0.43, respectively, in surface waters of the Chukchi/Bering Seas and the North Pacific Ocean. The concentration and condensation degree of DBC in the Chukchi/Bering Seas were higher and more variable than those in the subarctic and subtropical North Pacific, which implies that the major factors controlling DBC distribution were different in these marine provinces. In the Chukchi/Bering Seas, the DBC concentration was negatively correlated to salinity but positively correlated to chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) quantity and total dissolved lignin phenol concentration estimated by CDOM parameters. These correlations indicated that the possible major source of DBC in the Chukchi/Bering Seas was Arctic rivers. However, in the North Pacific, where riverine inputs are negligible for most sampling sites, DBC was possibly derived from the atmosphere. Although spectral slopes of CDOM at 275-295 nm (an index of the photodegradation degree of CDOM) differed widely between the subarctic and subtropical North Pacific, the concentration and condensation degrees of DBC were similar between the subarctic and subtropical North Pacific, which suggests that photodegradation was not the only major factor controlling DBC distribution. Therefore, DBC distributions of the North Pacific Ocean were considered to be mainly controlled by atmospheric deposition of BC and subsequent losses by photodegradation and adsorption onto sinking particles. This study implies that the main influence on DBC distribution in the open ocean and the coastal ocean are atmospheric deposition and fluvial inputs, respectively.

TI Uncertainties in the fate of nitrogen II: A quantitative assessment of
   the uncertainties in major nitrogen fluxes in the Netherlands
SO NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
AB Enhanced levels of nitrogen in the environment may have several adverse effects, including decreased plant species diversity in ( semi) natural terrestrial ecosystems, eutrophication of surface waters, pollution of ground-water due to nitrate leaching and global warming due to nitrous and nitrogen oxide (N2O and NOx) emissions. To determine the effectiveness of policies aimed at the reduction of emission of ammonia (NH3), N2O and NOx, nitrate (NO3) leaching and nitrogen (N) runoff, it is essential to have information on the fate of nitrogen in both agricultural and non-agricultural soils on a regional and national scale and its inherent uncertainties. In this paper, we quantified the uncertainties in the emission, uptake, accumulation, denitrification, leaching and runoff of nitrogen at a national scale and for specific land use-soil type combinations. Furthermore, we identified which parameters contribute most to the overall uncertainty in the emission of ammonia to the atmosphere and the leaching/runoff to groundwater and surface water. To gain quantitative insight into the propagation of the uncertainty, a model was developed representing all crucial processes in the N chain by simple process descriptions. Uncertainties were quantified for the Netherlands as a whole, including terrestrial systems, both agricultural and non-agricultural land, and aquatic systems. For agricultural and non-agricultural land, plots were distinguished, consisting of a multiple of 500 3 500 m and of 250 3 250 m grid cells, respectively, with unique combinations of soil use, soil type and groundwater table class that were derived from existing digital maps. Model parameters were assigned by using relationships with soil type, groundwater level class and land use. The uncertainty was quantified by means of a Monte Carlo analysis, whereas statistical approaches were used to identify which parameters contribute most to the overall uncertainty of the fate of nitrogen. The 90% confidence interval for the fluxes of N compounds to air, groundwater and surface water (in Gg N.yr(-1)) ranged between 102 and 194 for ammonia emission, between 18 and 51 for N2O emissions, between 32 and 108 for NO3 inflow to groundwater and between 2 and 38 for N inflow to surface water. The uncertainty in NH3 emission was mainly caused by the uncertainty in the NH3 emission fractions for animal manure, whereas the uncertainty in N2O emission was mainly due to the uncertainty in the fractions relating total nitrification and denitrification to N2O emissions. The uncertainty in inflow to groundwater and runoff to surface water was mainly caused by the uncertainty in denitrification in the soil and in upper groundwater and in non-agricultural soils also by the N accumulation in the soil. In view of the need to monitor and evaluate the impact of N reduction policies and measures, it is essential to put more effort in activities yielding a reduction of these large uncertainties, such as additional data gathering and process research under field circumstances.

TI Factors controlling groundwater salinization and hydrogeochemical
   processes in coastal aquifers from southern Spain
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB In detrital coastal aquifers, seawater and surface water may interact with groundwater in multiple ways. Understanding the interference of water fluxes in this type of environment is essential to effectively manage the groundwater resources in water-stressed regions, such as the Mediterranean coastal fringe. In this research, the characterization of the main hydrogeochemical processes and the interaction between surface water and groundwater in the Marbella-Estepona coastal aquifers (southern Spain) have been carried out by means of the combined use of different hydrogeochemical indicators along with isotope data. The results show that the diversity of source lithologies (peridotite, carbonate and/or metapelitic) substantially conditions the groundwater geochemistry. The analysis of ionic deltas made it possible a preliminary screening of the geochemical reactions that occur in the Marbella-Estepona aquifers, while the Discriminant Analysis allowed for a consistent classification of sampled groundwater types. The dissolution of calcite and dolomite determines the chemical composition of the groundwater from the eastern sector that are more conditioned by the rainwater infiltration. The dissolution of magnesium-bearing minerals (predominantly forming peridotite rocks) is observed in grodndwater samples from the western and central sectors, whose chemical composition showed a greater influence of surface water. The spatial analysis of rC1(-)/Br- in groundwater has permitted to corroborate that saline intrusion is negligible, hardly affecting to its original water quality. The irregularly distributed recharge by precipitation (seasonal effect) and the atmospheric circulation of cloud fronts (coastal/continental effect) explains why most of groundwater sampled is isotopically impoverished with respect to the rainfall signature. The isotope approach also suggests the hydraulic relationship between surface water and groundwater in the study site. A deeper knowledge of spatial hydrogeochemical variations in coastal groundwater and the influence of water sources over them are crucial for a sustainable groundwater management and global change adaptation in equivalent Mediterranean water -stressed regions.

TI Groundwater dependent ecosystems in coastal Mediterranean regions:
   Characterization, challenges and management for their protection
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Coastal lagoons deliver a wide range of valuable ecosystem goods and services. These ecosystems, that are often maintained by direct or indirect groundwater supplies, are collectively known as groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs). The importance of groundwater supplies is greatly exacerbated in coastal Mediterranean regions where the lack of surface water and the over-development of anthropogenic activities critically threaten the sustainability of coastal GDEs and associated ecosystem services.
   Yet, coastal GDEs do not benefit from a legal or managerial recognition to take into account their specificity. Particular attention should be paid to the characterization of environmental and ecological water requirements. The hydrogeological knowledge about the management and behavior of coastal aquifers and GDEs must be strengthened. These investigations must be supplemented by a stronger assessment of potential contaminations to develop local land-uses and human activities according to the groundwater vulnerability. The quantitative management of water resources must also be better supervised and/or more constrained in order to ensure the water needs necessary to maintain coastal GDEs.
   The transdisciplinary approach between hydrogeology, hydrology, social sciences and law is essential to fully understand the socio-economic and environmental complexity of coastal GDEs. Priority must now be given to the development of an appropriate definition of coastal GDEs, based on a consensus between scientists and lawyers. It is a necessary first step to develop and implement specific protective legislation and to define an appropriate management scale. The investment and collaboration of local water users, stakeholders and decision-makers need to be strengthened through actions to favor exchanges and discussions. All water resources in the coastal areas should be managed collectively and strategically, in order to maximize use efficiency, reduce water use conflicts and avoid over-exploitation. It is important to continue to raise public awareness of coastal aquifers at the regional level and to integrate their specificities into coastal zone management strategies and plans. In the global context of unprecedented anthropogenic pressures, hydro-food crises and climate change, environmental protection and preservation of coastal GDEs represents a major challenge for the sustainable socio-economic and environmental development of Mediterranean coastal zones.

TI Hydrochemical and Isotopic Applications in the Western Aosta Valley
   (Italy) for Sustainable Groundwater Management
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This research gives an overview of the status of water resources in the western Aosta Valley (Italy). Surface water, groundwater and precipitation were sampled during five sampling campaigns, and chemical analyses were performed and interpreted. Stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) were evaluated. This study highlights the relationships between water quality and quantity and local conditions (i.e., aquifer lithology, mixing into the aquifer, proximity to towns, contribution of snowmelt and ice melt to groundwater recharge, amount of rain, and season and altitude of the sampling location). A relationship between dust dispersed in the atmosphere as aerosols from the nearby Piedmont Region and the precipitation chemistry was identified, highlighting the presence of interregional conditions. Furthermore, isotopic analyses allowed the identification of aquifer feeding by both rainwater and glacial meltwater. Additionally, two origins for rainfall were identified: the Mediterranean Sea in winter and the Atlantic Ocean in summer. Finally, a local meteoric water line was calibrated for the study area. This research highlights the importance of implementing both traditional and isotopic techniques for water analysis to achieve optimal and sustainable management of water resources.

TI Changes in vegetation and surface water balance at basin-scale in
   Central China with rising atmospheric CO2
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration alters vegetation growth and composition, increases plant water use efficiency (WUE), and changes surface water balance. These changes and their differences between wet and dry climate are studied at a mid-latitude experiment site in the Loess Plateau of China. The study site, the Jinghe River basin (JRB), covers an area of 43,216 km(2) and has a semiarid climate in the north and a semi-humid climate in the south. Two simulations from 1965 to 2012 are made using a site-calibrated Lund-Potsdam-Jena dynamic global vegetation model: one with the observed rise of the atmospheric CO2 from 319.7-391.2 ppmv, and the other with a fixed CO2 at the level of 1964 (318.9 ppmv). Analyses of the model results show that the elevated atmospheric CO2 promotes growth of woody vegetation (trees) and causes a 6.0% increase in basin-wide net primary production (NPP). The NPP increase uses little extra water however because of higher WUE. Further examination of the surface water budget reveals opposite CO2 effects between semiarid and semi-humid climates in the JRB. In the semiarid climate, plants sustain growth in higher CO2 because of the higher level of intracellular CO2 and therefore WUE, thus consuming more water and causing a greater decrease of surface runoff than in the fixed-lower CO2 case. In the semi-humid climate, NPP also increases but by a smaller amount than in the semiarid climate. Plant transpiration (E-T) and total evapotranspiration (E) decrease in the elevated CO2 environment, yielding the increase of runoff. This asymmetry of the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 exacerbates drying in the semiarid climate and enhances wetness in the semi-humid climate. Furthermore, plant WUE (=NPP/E-T) is found to be nearly invariant to climate but primarily a function of the atmospheric CO2 concentration, a result suggesting a strong constraint of atmospheric CO2 on biophysical properties of the Earth system.

TI The spatiotemporal trajectory of US agricultural irrigation withdrawal
   during 1981-2015
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Irrigation has enhanced food security and biofuel production throughout the world. However, the sustainability of irrigation faces challenges from climate variability and extremes, increasing consumption from irrigated cropland expansion, and competing demands from other water use sectors. In this study, we investigated the agricultural water withdrawal landscape of the contiguous United States (CONUS) over 1981-2015, assessed its spatial and temporal changes, and analyzed the factors driving the changes. We introduced the concept of 'center of mass' to calculate the spatiotemporal trajectory of water withdrawal, along with climatic and agricultural factors at state, regional and CONUS scales. At the CONUS level, the total agricultural water withdrawal has decreased during 1981-2015, and the centroid of water withdrawal consistently moved toward the east, caused by reduced water withdrawal in the western states and increased withdrawal in the eastern states. While the CONUS irrigation trajectory is not mainly affected by climatologic trends, extreme drought conditions (e.g. the mega droughts in western states since 2000) may interrupt the trend. In the Western US, irrigation withdrawal reduction was mainly achieved by adoption of high-efficiency irrigation technology, while the irrigated acreage remains relatively stable. Under drought conditions, irrigation withdrawal often switched from surface water to groundwater sources, posing challenges on groundwater sustainability under prolonged drought conditions. The Eastern US has experienced accelerating agricultural withdrawal from both surface water and groundwater sources. This was mainly driven by expansion in irrigated acreage in the Midwest and lower Mississippi River, with irrigated croplands supplied by mixed flood irrigation and high-efficiency irrigation methods. At the state level, some states exhibited discrepancy in agricultural withdrawal centroids from surface water and groundwater sources, as results of climate heterogeneity, water availability and infrastructure development. This study provides understanding of the driving forces in the spatiotemporal trends of CONUS agricultural water withdrawal in different regions and implications for predicting future agricultural withdrawal under changing climatic and socioeconomic uncertainties.

TI Multiple-Line Identification of Socio-Ecological Stressors Affecting
   Aquatic Ecosystems in Semi-Arid Countries: Implications for Sustainable
   Management of Fisheries in Sub-Saharan Africa
SO WATER
AB Water resources are among the fundamental resources that are the most threatened worldwide by various pressures. This study applied the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework as an innovative tool to better understand the dynamic interlinkages between the different sources of multiple stressors on aquatic ecosystems in Burkina Faso. The triangulation of evidences from interviews, literature reviews, and strategic simulations shows that several human impacts as well as climate change and its effects (such as the decrease of the water level, and the increase of the surface water temperature) are detrimental to fish productivity, abundance, and average size. Furthermore, the ongoing demographic and nutritional transition is driving cumulative pressures on water and fish resources. In this context, the development of aquaculture could offer alternative livelihoods and help fish stocks in natural ecosystems to recover, thereby reducing fishermen's vulnerability and easing overfishing pressures. Further, the empowerment of the actors and their participation to reinforce fisheries regulation are required to escape the current "regeneration trap" and to achieve a sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems in Burkina Faso.

TI Watershed-Scale Evaluation of Flood Mitigation Benefits from Surface
   Water Diversion and Subsurface Injection in Coastal Louisiana
SO JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Coastal regions are witnessing unsustainable aquifer overdrafts, leading to subsidence and increased flooding. Flooding introduces its own assortment of problems because managing substantial volumes of stormwater is often infeasible through surface storage in low-gradient areas. Aquifer recharge operations, such as aquifer storage and recovery (ASR), in conjunction with small-scale surface reservoirs, has the potential to supplement the function of flood retention basins and provide additional flood relief to local communities. The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of surface water capture and injection at the local watershed level in mitigating flood impacts. The study is based on using a hydrologic-hydraulic numerical modeling analysis for a pilot watershed that was found to be suitable for aquifer recharge operations in the coastal region of south central Louisiana in the US. The concept of capturing excess surface water and injecting into the subsurface was found most effective during storms with multiple flood peaks and was able to add more than 75% reduction in flood peaks compared with using a retention basin alone. A key finding is that diverting surface flows into the subsurface can be effective only when implemented in conjunction with intermittent storage. The results also showed that the benefit of such operations is realized in the case of storms that have multiple flood peaks. The results have implications on the use of subsurface injections via techniques such as ASR for flood mitigation, in addition to their original purpose for groundwater management and sustainability.

TI Microbe, climate change and marine environment: Linking trends and
   research hotspots
SO MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Microbes, or microorganisms, have been the foundation of the biosphere for over 3 billion years and have played an essential role in shaping our planet. The available knowledge on the topic of microbes associated with climate change has the potential to reshape upcoming research trends globally. As climate change impacts the ocean or marine ecosystem, the responses of these "unseen life" will heavily influence the achievement of a sustainable evolutionary environment. The present study aims to identify microbial-related research under changing climate within the marine environment through the mapping of visualized graphs of the available literature. We used scientometric methods to retrieve documents from the Web of Science platform in the Core Collection (WOSCC) database, analyzing a total of 2767 documents based on scientometric indicators. Our findings show that this research area is growing exponentially, with the most influential keywords being "microbial diversity," "bacteria," and "ocean acidification," and the most cited being "microorganism" and "diversity." The identification of influential clusters in the field of marine science provides insight into the hot spots and frontiers of research in this area. Prominent clusters include "coral microbiome," "hypoxic zone," "novel Thermoplasmatota clade," "marine dinoflagellate bloom," and "human health." Analyzing emerging trends and transformative changes in this field can inform the creation of special issues or research topics in selected journals, thus increasing visibility and engagement among the scientific community.

TI Modelling the hydro-geochemistry of acid-sensitive catchments in Finland
   under atmospheric deposition and biomass harvesting scenarios
SO BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB The dynamic hydro-geochemical Model of Acidification of Groundwater in Catchments (MAGIC) was used to predict the response of 163 Finnish lake catchments to historic and future atmospheric deposition (1880-2100) and future tree harvesting practices. Deposition was assumed to follow current legislated European emission reduction policies (CLe) and a scenario based on maximum (technically) feasible reductions (MFR). Future harvesting was assumed to shift from stem-only harvesting (SOH) to whole-tree harvesting (WTH) owing to the potential increased utilisation of biofuels. Despite the modest changes in atmospheric deposition under CLe (compared to current day), these reductions are predicted to halt the decline in soil base saturation; however, further reductions are required to improve soil and lake water chemistry. The MFR scenario predicted a significant long-term improvement in soil base saturation leading to continued long-term recovery in surface waters (all lakes with ANC > 0 by 2100). However under the WTH scenario, significant long-term impacts (re-acidification) were predicted for soil and surface water chemistry (14 lakes with ANC < 0 by 2100). To some extent the long-term negative impacts were reduced under MFR, indicating that increased utilisation of biofuels will necessitate 'trading emissions for timber', or soil amendment, to maintain ecosystem quality and sustainable forest growth. The current practice of SOH is close to the sustainable maximum harvesting under current (legislated) atmospheric deposition in Finland.

TI Community composition of ammonia-oxidizing archaea from surface and
   anoxic depths of oceanic oxygen minimum zones
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) have been reported at high abundance in much of the global ocean, even in environments, such as pelagic oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), where conditions seem unlikely to support aerobic ammonium oxidation. Due to the lack of information on any potential alternative metabolism of AOA, the AOA community composition might be expected to differ between oxic and anoxic environments. This hypothesis was tested by evaluating AOA community composition using a functional gene microarray that targets the ammonia monooxygenase gene subunit A (amoA). The relationship between environmental parameters and the biogeography of the Arabian Sea and the Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ETSP) AOA assemblages was investigated using principal component analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA). In both the Arabian Sea and the ETSP AOA communities within the core of the OMZ were not significantly different from those inhabiting the oxygenated surface waters above the OMZ. The AOA communities in the Arabian Sea were significantly different from those in the ETSP. In both oceans, the abundance of archaeal amoA gene in the core of the OMZ was higher than that in the surface waters. Our results indicate that AOA communities are distinguished by their geographic origin. RDA suggested that temperature (higher in the Arabian Sea than in the ETSP) was the main factor that correlated with the differences between the AOA communities. Physicochemical properties that characterized the different environments of the OMZ and surface waters played a less important role, than did geography, in shaping the AOA community composition.

TI Assessment of surface water quality of inland valleys for cropping in SW
   Nigeria
SO APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
AB Inland valley agro-ecosystems which are a category of wetlands have potential for sustainable crop production relative to uplands. A major challenge to their utilisation in the study area is their heterogeneity in hydrology, morphology, soil types and agro-economy. The study assessed the surface water quality of three typologies of the agro-ecosystems-amphitheatre-like valley-heads (Am), valley-side (VS), and low depression (LD)-for cropping. Surface water of six sites were sampled during the wet and dry seasons. The physicochemical properties and metal concentrations of the samples were analysed. Descriptive statistics and water quality indices were used to assess the suitability of the waters of the agro-ecosystems for cropping. Results showed that the valleys have neutral to slightly alkaline waters. Values of physicochemical parameters are generally within the acceptable range for cropping. The concentration of major cations varied across the inland valley types, but exhibited similar characteristics within each valley. The dominance of the major cations is in the order of Na > Ca > K > Mg. ANOVA results indicated that there is no significant difference in the concentration of heavy metals across the valleys (F = 2.044, p = 0.138, alpha = 0.05). Generally, most of the physicochemical parameters and trace metals have low concentrations and are non-toxic to plants. Values of water quality indices (sodium adsorption ratio, soluble sodium percentage, total dissolved solids and permeability index) indicated that the concentrations of minerals in waters across the valley typologies are generally within permissible limits for cropping.

TI Microcystins in potable surface waters: toxic effects and removal
   strategies
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED TOXICOLOGY
AB In freshwater, harmful cyanobacterial blooms threaten to increase with global climate change and eutrophication of surface waters. In addition to the burden and necessity of removal of algal material during water treatment processes, bloom-forming cyanobacteria can produce a class of remarkably stable toxins, microcystins, difficult to remove from drinking water sources. A number of animal intoxications over the past 20 years have served as sentinels for widespread risk presented by microcystins. Cyanobacterial blooms have the potential to threaten severely both public health and the regional economy of affected communities, particularly those with limited infrastructure or resources. Our main objectives were to assess whether existing water treatment infrastructure provides sufficient protection against microcystin exposure, identify available options feasible to implement in resource-limited communities in bloom scenarios and to identify strategies for improved solutions. Finally, interventions at the watershed level aimed at bloom prevention and risk reduction for entry into potable water sources were outlined. We evaluated primary studies, reviews and reports for treatment options for microcystins in surface waters, potable water sources and treatment plants. Because of the difficulty of removal of microcystins, prevention is ideal; once in the public water supply, the coarse removal of cyanobacterial cells combined with secondary carbon filtration of dissolved toxins currently provides the greatest potential for protection of public health. Options for point of use filtration must be optimized to provide affordable and adequate protection for affected communities. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Origin and residence time of shallow groundwater resources in Lagos
   coastal basin, south-west Nigeria: An isotopic approach
SO HELIYON
AB Knowledge of the source of water in the Lagos coastal basin (LCB) groundwater system was to be found vital to the future development and management of the system. Stable and radioactive isotopic measurements have been employed to unravel the source of recharge and residence time of the shallow groundwater system, based on the sampling conducted in 2016 and 2017 on groundwater, surface water and rainfall. The concentration of tritium in the groundwater samples were very low and ranged from less than 1 to 2.8 TU, while measured C-14 contents ranged from 59.1 to 88 pMC. The delta O-18 values of groundwater samples ranged from 4.81 and 3.98 parts per thousand, while the delta H-2 values ranged from -24.75 and -19.70 parts per thousand for the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The obtained results indicated non-existence of paleo recharge; rather all groundwater in the basin were found to be essentially of meteoric origin with intermittent surface water contributions. Moreover, shallow groundwater and surface water have considerable variations in isotopic compositions, reflecting evaporation and preservation of seasonal fluctuation. Though there was an observed generally low tritium content, however, it proved useful in the identification of recent active recharge taking place across the basin. The deduced radiocarbon age reflected the presence of "modern water" and thus supports the presence of present recharge to the groundwater system. Therefore, the source of the shallow groundwater recharge was actively renewable particularly during the wet season and thus water exploitation is potentially sustainable in the basin.

TI Risk management for arsenic in agricultural soil-water systems: lessons
   learned from case studies in Europe
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Chronic exposure to arsenic may be detrimental to health. We investigated the behaviour, remediation and risk management of arsenic in Freiberg, Germany, characterized by past mining activities, and near Verdun in France, where World War I ammunition was destroyed. The main results included: (1) pot experiments using a biologically synthesized adsorbent (sorpP) with spring barley reduced the mobility of arsenic, (2) the Omega-3 Index ecotoxicological tests verified that sorpP reduced the uptake and toxicity of arsenic in plants, (3) reverse osmosis membrane systems provided 99.5% removal efficiency of arsenic from surface water, (4) the sustainability assessment revealed that adsorption and coagulation-filtration processes were the most feasible options for the treatment of surface waters with significant arsenic concentrations, and (5) a model was developed for assessing health risk due to arsenic exposure. Risk management is the main option for extensive areas, while remediation options that directly treat the soil can only be considered in small areas subject to sensitive use. We recommend the risk management procedure developed in Germany for other parts of the world where both geogenic and anthropogenic arsenic is present in agricultural soil and water. Risk management measures have been successful both in Freiberg and in Verdun.

TI Innovative Approaches to Collaborative Groundwater Governance in the
   United States: Case Studies from Three High-Growth Regions in the Sun
   Belt
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Groundwater is an increasingly important source of freshwater, especially where surface water resources are fully or over-allocated or becoming less reliable due to climate change. Groundwater reliance has created new challenges for sustainable management. This article examines how regional groundwater users coordinate and collaborate to manage shared groundwater resources, including attention to what drives collaboration. To identify and illustrate these facets, this article examines three geographically diverse cases of groundwater governance and management from the United States Sun Belt: Orange County Water District in southern California; Prescott Active Management Area in north-central Arizona; and the Central Florida Water Initiative in central Florida. These regions have different surface water laws, groundwater allocation and management laws and regulations, demographics, economics, topographies, and climate. These cases were selected because the Sun Belt faces similar pressures on groundwater due to historical and projected population growth and limited availability of usable surface water supplies. Collectively, they demonstrate groundwater governance trends in the United States, and illustrate distinctive features of regional groundwater management strategies. Our research shows how geophysical realities and state-level legislation have enabled and/or stimulated regions to develop groundwater management plans and strategies to address the specific issues associated with their groundwater resources. We find that litigation involvement and avoidance, along with the need to finance projects, are additional drivers of regional collaboration to manage groundwater. This case study underscores the importance of regionally coordinated and sustained efforts to address serious groundwater utilization challenges faced by the regions studied and around the world.

TI Mixed Integer Linear Fractional Programming for Conjunctive Use of
   Surface Water and Groundwater
SO JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB A conjunctive-use model is developed for management of groundwater and surface water resources via mixed integer linear fractional programming (MILFP). The objective of the conjunctive-use model is to maximize the ratio of groundwater usage to surface water usage through a water supply network. A conditional head constraint is imposed to the conjunctive-use model to maintain aquifer sustainability. A transformation approach is introduced to transform the conditional head constraint into a set of mixed integer linear constraints in terms of groundwater head. Groundwater head is further linearized with respect to pumping rates that are decision variables. Eventually, the conjunctive-use model is to solve a successive MILFP problem by updating the response matrix in each iteration. To make an MILFP problem tractable, the study develops a transformation technique along with the Charnes-Cooper transformation approach to transform an MILFP problem into an equivalent problem of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to be solved by CPLEX. The proposed conjunctive-use model is applied to northern Louisiana. A water supply network is proposed to utilize four existing reservoirs as alternative resources in order to raise groundwater level in the Sparta aquifer to acceptable target level in Ouachita, Lincoln, and Union Parishes while maximizing groundwater pumping. The results show that the conjunctive-use management framework increases groundwater levels by an average of 6.96m (22.82ft) from 2001 to 2010 by reducing total groundwater withdrawal 28.93%, which is counterbalanced by reservoir water.

TI Forest Soil Calcium Dynamics and Water Quality: Implications for Forest
   Management Planning
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
AB Forest management planning is increasingly focused at the landscape scale. The resulting increase in planning unit size has fueled debate about forest sustainability, particularly at local scales. In boreal and temperate regions, Ca depletion in forest and aquatic ecosystems is a recently debated issue. Planning decisions that sustain forest soil and surface water Ca require identification of sites sensitive to Ca loss and application of silvicultural prescriptions that maintain background Ca pools and fluxes. Therefore, I synthesized data on forest Ca cycling and export and long-term (>10 yr) soil exchangeable Ca pools and changes in surface water quality. Findings indicated that hardwood forest soils contained over three-times more (P < 0.05), their catchments exported three-times more (P < 0.05), and through leaf-litter fall they recycled twice (p < 0.01) as much Ca as conifer-mixedwood forests. Nonetheless, over similar timeframes, forest floor in mature hardwood stands lost more (P < 0.05) Ca than did conifer-mixedwood soils, which was consistent with net stream and lake Ca losses (P < 0.01). However, surface water acid neutralizing capacity increased (P < 0.01), possibly due to greater sulfate declines relative to Ca. On average, based on soil concentrations and contents, forestry practices did not significantly deplete Ca in either cover type. Study results indicate that stand-and catchment-scale forest Ca pools and fluxes can be used to identify areas potentially sensitive to Ca depletion and water quality degradation. However, considerable variation exists in Ca and acidification responses to external stressors, limiting spatial and temporal projections.

TI Groundwater resources of a multi-layered aquiferous system in arid area:
   Data analysis and water budgeting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The Maknassy basin in central Tunisia receives insignificant precipitation (207 mm/y), but the hydrological system retain very small quantities of water due to the steep topography and surface water resource partially mobilised witch is evacuated toward the basin outlet. However, the Maknassy plain support agriculture based on ground water irrigation with increasing water demand last decades. These developments have boosted agricultural productivity in the region. While these problems are mainly due to poor surface water management strategies in the region, the groundwater resources in this basin should be properly assessed and suitable measures taken for uniform surface water mobilization. As a first step in this direction, groundwater resources have been assessed. Regional specific yield (0.017) and groundwater recharge have been estimated on the basis of water table fluctuation method. Groundwater recharge amounting to 61.5 10(6) m(3) in a year takes place in the region through infiltration of rainwater (48.1 * 10(6) m(3) for phreatic aquifer and 13.4* 10(6) m(3) for the deep one), and recharge due to the infiltration in the Leben quady bed (1.57* 10(6) m(3)). Recharge to deeper aquifers has been estimated at 0.1* 10(6) m(3) during dry seasons. Assuming that at least 40% (102.61* 10(6) m(3)) of the total precipitation water (256.64* 10(6) m(3)) makes the runoff water, this important resource can be mobilized in order to increase groundwater recharge. Subject to an and climate, such region requires an integrated water resource management. It permits to keep aquiferous system equilibrium and participate to the sustainable development which integrates natural resource management.

TI Spatial Data Management and Numerical Modelling: Demonstrating the
   Application of the QGIS-Integrated FREEWAT Platform at 13 Case Studies
   for Tackling Groundwater Resource Management
SO WATER
AB Because of the spatial nature of groundwater-related data and their time component, effective groundwater management requires the application of methods pertaining to the Information and Communication Technologies sector, such as spatial data management and distributed numerical modelling. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the QGIS-integrated FREEWAT platform and an approach combining spatial data management and numerical models to target groundwater management issues. FREEWAT is a free and open source platform integrated in a Geographic Information System environment and embedding tools for pre- and post-processing of spatial data and integrating numerical codes for the simulation of the hydrological cycle, with a main focus on groundwater. To this aim, this paper briefly presents the FREEWAT platform, introduces the FREEWAT approach, and showcases 13 case studies in European and non-European countries where the FREEWAT platform was applied. Application of the FREEWAT platform to real-world case studies is presented for targeting management of coastal aquifers, ground- and surface-water interaction, climate change impacts, management of transboundary aquifers, rural water management and protection of groundwater-dependent ecosystems. In this sense, compared to other existing software suites, FREEWAT allows data analysis and visualization to accomplish each step of the modelling workflow, i.e., from data analytics, to conceptual model definition, to numerical modelling and reporting of results. The presented experiences demonstrate that improved access to data and the portability of models and models' results can help to promote water sustainability from the local- to the basin-scale. Furthermore, FREEWAT may represent a valuable tool to target the objective of increasing the capabilities of public authorities and private companies to manage groundwater resources by means of up-to-date, robust, well-documented and reliable software, without entailing the need of costly licensing, nowadays seldom affordable by public water authorities. Based on the strengths highlighted, the FREEWAT platform is a powerful tool for groundwater resources management, and for data collection, sharing, implementation and comparison of scenarios, for supporting planning and decision-making.

TI Global occurrence of anti-infectives in contaminated surface waters:
   Impact of income inequality between countries
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB The presence anti-infectives in environmental waters is of interest because of their potential role in the dissemination of anti-infective resistance in bacteria and other harmful effects on non-target species such as algae and shellfish. Since no information on global trends regarding the contamination caused by these bioactive substances is yet available, we decided to investigate the impact of income inequality between countries on the occurrence of anti-infectives in surface waters. In order to perform such study, we gathered concentration values reported in the peer-reviewed literature between 1998 and 2014 and built a database. To fill the gap of knowledge on occurrence of anti-infectives in African countries, we also collected 61 surface water samples from Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique and South Africa, and measured concentrations of 19 anti-infectives. A mixed one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, followed by Turkey-Kramer post hoc tests was used to identify potential differences in anti-infective occurrence between countries grouped by income level (high, upper-middle and lower-middle and low income) according to the classification by the World Bank. Comparison of occurrence of anti-infectives according to income level revealed that concentrations of these substances in contaminated surface waters were significantly higher in low and lower-middle income countries (p = 0.0001) but not in upper-middle income countries (p = 0.0515) compared to high-income countries. We explained these results as the consequence of the absence of or limited sewage treatment performed in lower income countries. Furthermore, comparison of concentrations of low cost anti-infectives (sulfonamides and trimethoprim) and the more expensive macrolides between income groups suggest that the cost of these substances may have an impact on their environmental occurrence in lower income countries. Since wastewaters are the most important source of contamination of anti-infectives and other contaminants of emerging concern in the environment, it is expected that deleterious effects to the aquatic biota caused by these substances will be more pronounced in countries with inadequate wastewater and collection infrastructure. With the information currently available, we could not evaluate either the role of the receiving environment or the importance of regulatory frameworks on the occurrence of anti-infectives in surface waters. Future studies should focus on these two factors in order to better evaluate risks to aquatic ecosystems in LM&LICs. We propose that CECs such as anti-infectives could be used as a new class of environmental degradation indicators that could be helpful to assess the state of development of wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure around the world.

AB The society has been playing more and more significant role in EU's and Hungary's environmental policy considering that environmental consciousness of the people raised increasing demand oil environmental information. The bottleneck of this process is the lack Of public information oil environmental data. Therefore it is essential that the residents of small regions may easily access information oil the state of their narrower environment and have the possibility to take part in the decision process. The Institute of Environmental Engineering, University of Pannonia has undertaken this challenge and developed ail online environmental information system. This system is able to receive and process the collected environmental data via Internet. These data oil the environmental elements (air, Surface water, noise) are then available to the public as a web service displayed by GIS and graphical tools. The system had to meet simplicity and comprehensibility. The database can be efficiently used in areas where displaying spatial information on maps is important. Aim of the project to define physical and chemical parameters Of Surface waters and apply Water Framework Directive (WFD) for examined water bodies further goal is to display results via internet in Environmental information System developed by its authors. As the load to Our surface water became greater, it created increasing demand for adequate quality and quantity waters. A good condition is available with prevention of the quality ruin and provides sustainable water management. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) was created as the long-term water policy of the European Union. Member States have required achieve good ecological and chemical status in all bodies of surface water by 2015. Measurements and water sampling were taken at the examined streams. Streams were categorized according to typology. The field measurement (temperature, pH, conductivity, chlorophyll-a, PAH) and laboratory texts (COD(t), PO(4)(3-), NH(4)(+), NO(3)(-), NO(2)(-), SO(4)(2-), Na(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+), K(+), Si(4+), Cd(2+), Co(2+), Cr(3+), Ni(2+), Zn(2+)) has been taken. Measured results have been compared with MSZ 12749 standards and accordingly streams were classified. Bedrock has taken effect via main ions of the water so this element of the typology has been proved by main ions. According to results of the examined water the followings were determined: nitrate, nitrite and phosphate-ion from the gardens, agriculture areas and sewage significantly Pollute the surface water. Traffic means further Pollution, in this case organic Compounds or heavy metals can solve out to the water. Oil the homepage bar charts show measured values at different sampling sites of the streams. Oil the Google Map distances between two sampling sites were coloured according to water quality colour scale. These provide generic information about condition of watercourse comprehensible for everyone.

TI Perfluorinated alkylated substances in the aquatic environment: An
   Austrian case study
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Perfluorinated alkylated substances (PFAS) are of global interest due to their occurrence and persistency in the environment. This study includes surface waters and sediments for the analysis of eleven PFAS. The PFAS studied can be grouped in perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs), perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFS) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides (PFSA). The two most important compounds are perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). These two substances showed the most significant values for surface water samples with maximum concentrations of 21 ng l(-1) for PFOA and 37 ng l(-1) for PFOS. Sediment samples from seven Austrian lakes and the river Danube were studied. Whereas PFSA and PFS were not detected in any sediment sample PFCAs were detected in most of the lake samples in concentrations up to 1.7 mu g kg(-1) dry wt. PFOA, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) and perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) were detected in all Danube river sediment samples in concentrations varying from 0.1 up to 5.1 mu g kg(-1) dry wt. For the various sampling points the proportional mass flows deriving from wastewater discharges were calculated. Whereas only up to 10% of the average flow is discharged wastewater up to more than 50% of the PFAS mass flows in the rivers can be attributed to wastewater discharges. Besides wastewater different other pathways as emissions from point sources, further degradation of precursor products, runoff from contaminated sites or surface runoff as well as dry and wet deposition have to be considered as relevant sources for PFAS contamination in surface waters.

TI Simulation-Optimization for Conjunctive Water Resources Management and
   Optimal Crop Planning in Kushabhadra-Bhargavi River Delta of Eastern
   India
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Water resources sustainability is a worldwide concern because of climate variability, growing population, and excessive groundwater exploitation in order to meet freshwater demand. Addressing these conflicting challenges sometimes can be aided by using both simulation and mathematical optimization tools. This study combines a groundwater-flow simulation model and two optimization models to develop optimal reconnaissance-level water management strategies. For a given set of hydrologic and management constraints, both of the optimization models are applied to part of the Mahanadi River basin groundwater system, which is an important source of water supply in Odisha State, India. The first optimization model employs a calibrated groundwater simulation model (MODFLOW-2005, the U.S. Geological Survey modular ground-water model) within the Simulation-Optimization MOdeling System (SOMOS) module number 1 (SOMO1) to estimate maximum permissible groundwater extraction, subject to suitable constraints that protect the aquifer from seawater intrusion. The second optimization model uses linear programming optimization to: (a) optimize conjunctive allocation of surface water and groundwater and (b) to determine a cropping pattern that maximizes net annual returns from crop yields, without causing seawater intrusion. Together, the optimization models consider the weather seasons, and the suitability and variability of existing cultivable land, crops, and the hydrogeologic system better than the models that do not employ the distributed maximum groundwater pumping rates that will not induce seawater intrusion. The optimization outcomes suggest that minimizing agricultural rice cultivation (especially during the non-monsoon season) and increasing crop diversification would improve farmers' livelihoods and aid sustainable use of water resources.

TI Distribution and source of microplastics in China's second largest
   reservoir - Danjiangkou Reservoir
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB Fresh water microplastic pollution is of pressing concern globally, but its distribution and sources in reservoirs are poorly documented. Danjiangkou Reservoir is the second largest reservoir in China and is divided into the Han Reservoir and Dan Reservoir. In this work, microplastic abundances and morphological characteristics of the reservoir were investigated. The microplastic abundance of 15 main tributaries of the reservoir was also measured. The vertical distribution (in water column and sediment), horizontal distribution (in Han Reservoir and Dan Reservoir) and source of microplastics were analyzed. Microplastics accumulated in the middle layer of the reservoir, and the size and color of the microplastic particles changed from the surface to the bottom, which implies that surveys of surface water are not enough to determine the microplastic contamination for deep water reservoirs. In the surface water, the microplastic abundance in the Han Reservoir was lower than that in the Dan Reservoir (p < 0.05), but microplastic abundance did not differ significantly in the intermediate and bottom water. Tributaries were one of the main sources of microplastics for Han Reservoir but not for Dan Reservoir. Agricultural cultivation in the hydro-fluctuation belt might be an important source of microplastics in the Dan Reservoir, which should be given additional attention. The results of this study can provide valuable information for developing microplastic sampling strategies in deep water reservoirs. Further studies are recommended to investigate the process through which microplastics in the hydro-fluctuation belt enter the reservoir and the sinking behavior of microplastics in the reservoir.

TI Surface Water Organophosphorus Pesticides Concentration and Distribution
   in the Langat River, Selangor, Malaysia
SO EXPOSURE AND HEALTH
AB Pesticide contamination in the environment is a contemporary global issue. As agricultural production through crop planting in Malaysia now supports both energy and food productions, the concentration and distribution of pesticides in surface water may have changed. Therefore, this study assesses the concentration and distribution of organophosphorus pesticides (quinalphos, diazinon and chlorpyrifos) contamination in the Langat River, Selangor. The Langat River Basin is one of the most populated river basins in Malaysia. As a result, it is surrounded by various environmental stresses of which agricultural activity is a dominant cause. An analytical method has been developed and optimised based on solid-phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography, coupled with a diode array detector (SPE-HPLC-DAD). This method allowed for the determination and quantification of selected organophosphorus pesticides. The optimised method displays a high mean recovery for both quinalphos and diazinon (100.21 and 100.15 %, respectively) but relatively low recovery for chlorpyrifos (32.40 %). The low recovery of chlorpyrifos is due to limitations in the determination of multi-residues in a single analytical run, optimisation of chromatographic conditions and the recovery of each compound. The method detection limit was found to be 0.003 mu g/L for quinalphos and diazinon, and 0.006 mu g/L for chlorpyrifos. Sample analyses revealed the occurrence of quinalphos, diazinon and chlorpyrifos in the Langat River with chlorpyrifos found to have the highest mean concentration of 0.0202 mu g/L. The quinalphos and diazinon sample concentrations were 0.0178 mu g/L and 0.0094 mu g/L, respectively. The concentrations of organophosphorus pesticides in this monitoring study were found to be below the Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) established under the European Union (Drinking Water) Regulation 2014. This study was the first to detect concentrations of quinalphos and diazinon in the Langat River, Selangor.

TI Spatial distribution of metals in ground/surface waters in the
   Chandrapur district (Central India) and their plausible sources
SO ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY
AB This study addresses a framework to evaluate and map environmental hazard with reference to spatial distribution of major and trace metal contamination and its relationship with lithology in Chandrapur district of Maharashtra, India using geospatial, statistical and GIS tools. In all, 208 ground water and 35 surface water samples were collected using global positioning system (GPS) synoptically with satellite imagery IRS P6 LISS III and were analyzed in ICP-AES. Analytical results reflect the presence of major and trace metals in ground water in terms of % as Fe (48%), Mn (12%), Zn (9%), Al (8%), Pb (7%), Cu (6%), Ni (4%), Cd (3%) and Cr (3%) of the total average concentration. The contamination is attributed to weathering of rocks and also to mining activities. Similarly, surface water contribution of major and trace metals was found as Al (47.8%), Fe (42.8%), Mn (5.5%), Zn (2.3%), Pb (0.56%), Ni (0.42%), Cu (0.16%), Cr ( 0.16%) and Cd (0.10%) of the total average concentration. Ordinary kriging interpolation method was adopted to assess the spatial distribution of different major and trace metals in groundwater samples with their best model fit variogram Classical statistical method like principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out in order to establish correlation between spatial pattern of metal contamination and geology of the area in GIS environment. Various surface and subsurface aspects like landuse/land cover, structural features, hydrogeology, topography etc were also considered to ascertain their impact to supplement the inference of the study.

TI Multivariate and spatial methods-based water quality assessment of Chu
   Tran Valley, Gilgit Baltistan
SO APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
AB Current study was performed to evaluate the physico-chemical, metals and microbial characteristics of the surface water available in Chu Tran valley located in sub-district Shigar of district Skardu, Gilgit Baltistan, Pakistan. A total of 24 water samples were collected and analysed to determine the water quality index (WQI). Multivariate analysis comprising principal component analysis (PCA) and spatial distribution using inverse distance weight (IDW) interpolation were also employed to ascertain the water quality available in the valley and public health concern assessment. The results of WQI comprehended that physico-chemical characteristics of the water samples are excellent. However, the concentration of metals in water samples is higher than recommended WHO standards and public health quality of water supply is not satisfactory; therefore, the water in the valley is unfit of human consumption. Multivariate analysis with PCA technology identified important water quality parameters and revealed that metals and microbial concentrations are major later factors which have significant influence on the water quality. IDW-based spatial distribution indicates that water samples collected from the central part of the valley are highly contaminated with metals and microbial load. This is the region where the major human settlements are located and agricultural activities, domestic dischargers and erosion are the fundamental sources of water pollution. People have no choice except to consume the contaminated water as no other water supply is available and hardly question about the water quality. The study also proved that combination of WQI, PCA and IDW is effective and promising tools for surface water quality assessment in other areas in order to get accurate results for public health monitoring. It is recommended that the sources of contaminations can be further explored to reduce the pollution load of the surface water of Chu Tran Valley that might be helpful in the promotion of sustainable ecotourism.

AB The Itapicuru River basin is located in the northeast of the State of Bahia, Brazil. It is a large basin with variable conditions in terms of soil, climate, topography, natural vegetation, and economy. About 80% of the total area is subjected to severe drought periods. Poor cropping systems and lack of adequate systems for disposing wastewater from the urban areas determine the water quality along the basin. This proposal airns to carry out a study on the actual situation of the surface water resources, including diagnostic and prognostic actions. The study presents a spatial analysis of the surface water quality using hydro chemical data of the water and sediments from 30 stations along the river and the tributaries, including points in the reservoirs of the dam and estuary region. The main processes related with the water quality are: erosion, concentrations of salt and nutrients, punctual contamination of metals and bacteria. The spatial distribution of the parameters in the different points is illustrated in maps. Zones showing higher values of coliforms, nitrogen, phosphor, chloride, conductivity and nitrates are in the high and medium part of the river, where there is low rainfall, higher demographic density and expressive social-economic dynamics. Closer to the chromium mines the concentration of iron and chromium in the sediments is above the limits. The results are associated with the environmental quality in order to have a characterization of the hydro chemical and social-economic elements, in different scales. Also critical areas are defined in detailed studies to help implement corrective actions to minimize or eliminate the contamination problems. It is expected that the results and achievements of this project will be useful in order to support the development of state and federal programs on the sustainability of water resources in the region.

TI LATE QUATERNARY GLACIAL INTERGLACIAL CHANGES IN SEDIMENT COMPOSITION AT
   THE EAST GREENLAND CONTINENTAL-MARGIN AND THEIR PALEOCEANOGRAPHIC
   IMPLICATIONS
SO MARINE GEOLOGY
AB Stable isotope records, and sedimentological and organic-geochemical investigations of marine sediments from the east Greenland Sea at 70-degrees-N provide important information about glacial-interglacial variations of paleoenvironments through the last 225 kyr.
   The oxygen isotope records established on the planktonic foraminifer N. pachyderma sin. show some excursions from the global climate pattern, probably due to local/regional overprint by meltwater supply.  The cold, low-saline East Greenland Current and fluctuations in sea-ice covering were a crucial element controlling the carbonate production in the subsurface/surface water column in the east Greenland Sea over the last 225 kyr.  The beginning of Termination Ia is AMS C-14 dated at about 15.8 kyr B.P. and interpreted as a Greenland Ice Sheet meltwater signal.  The stage 2/3 boundary is dated at about 25 kyr B.P.  The timing of the onset of the last deglacial meltwater event is about 800 years earlier than that of the Barents Shelf Ice Sheet meltwater signal recorded in the Fram Strait.
   Several major pulses of increased supply of coarse-grained terrigenous material by glacio-marine processes occurred during the last 225 kyr.  The supply of coarse-grained ice-grafted debris at the East Greenland continental slope reached maximum values during the last glacial maximum (stage 2/Weichselian, 15-19 kyr B.P.).
   The drastic climatic change and the gradual retreat of continental ice masses/glaciers during the last deglaciation (Termination I) are clearly documented in the marine sedimentary sequences from shelf and upper slope environments.  This process resulted in distinctly decreased supply and deposition of ice-rafted debris in the open shelf-upper slope environments.  During Termination I, the sea-ice cover also decreased, causing an increase in surface-water productivity, indicated by increased organic carbon and biogenic opal deposition.

TI Assessment of Groundwater Quality under Changing Climate in Ngorongoro

SO JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING
AB Understanding the hydrochemical composition of water resources in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA, Dodoma, Tanzania) related to climate variability is essential for sustainable development. Thus, the current study used the HYDRUS-1D model to assess the groundwater quality change due to the leaching of hydrochemicals from surface water under the climate variability of the NCA. This study observed that the area's surface water had varying hydrochemical contaminants, whereas the groundwater is currently most suitable for drinking and domestic purposes. However, it is predicted that two anions (Cl-1 and PO4(-3)) and two cations (Na+ and K+) are expected to exceed the permissible limits from 2036 to 2050, considering the anticipated climatic conditions. Changes in groundwater quality for cations and anions are significantly correlated to evapotranspiration and temperature, with Pearson's coefficient of determinations r between 0.35 and 0.66. The findings of this study are necessary to benchmark better water resources management planning. (C) 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI DRY PERIODS IMPACT ON THE SURFACE WATER QUALITY
SO PRESENT ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Current changes of the environment represent the major threats to the sustainable development and are one of the biggest problems, with negative consequences on the national economy. The accelerated pace of these changes is shareholder and by the manifestation of extreme events, which in recent years become more intense and frequent. The drought events frequent manifestation over the Republic of Moldova territory, in the context of climate change, requires a scientific monitoring adjusted.
   The dry period's manifestation is greatly conditioned by increasing daytime temperatures (above 25 degrees C) and the lower relative humidity (below 30%). At present, on the background of climate change, there is an increase of dry days. Over the Republic of Moldova territory, their occurrence during growth and development of crops particularly damaging role in obtaining low yields. Meanwhile, prolonged dry periods, may possibly cause fires, at the same time can determine lands' irrigation and surface water quality.
   In this context, there is a need to estimate the evaporation's spatial and temporal variability, the number of dry days and their correlation to Dry Periods Index (Izu), the index developed at regional level.

TI Interseasonal irrigation system planning for waterlogged sodic soils
SO JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING
AB Irrigation system planning and management of a semiarid region in Indian Punjab is imperative for sustainable agriculture. For the management of soil and water resources of these regions, three nonstructural management models have been developed and linked together to aid in planning the optimum allocation of land and water resources to achieve the objective of maximizing return in the command area of a canal distributary. A ground-water simulation model uses the mass-balance approach to simulate water-table depths. The seasonal crop water response models are developed to compute crop yields. Interseasonal irrigation system planning models maximize net annual return through conjunctive use of surface water and gypsum-treated sodic ground water to achieve an optimal cropping pattern using a linear programming algorithm. The linear programming models are operated at five water mixing indexes (mixing of surface water and poor quality ground water in different proportions) and seven probability of exceedence levels where rainfall, crop water requirements, and canal water supply are assumed as random variables. These random variables are fitted well to the gamma probability density function.

TI Identifying flood recharge and inter-aquifer connectivity using multiple
   isotopes in subtropical Australia
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB An understanding of hydrological processes is vital for the sustainable management of groundwater resources, especially in areas where an aquifer interacts with surface water systems or where aquifer interconnectivity occurs. This is particularly important in areas that are subjected to frequent drought/flood cycles, such as the Cressbrook Creek catchment in Southeast Queensland, Australia. In order to understand the hydrological response to flooding and to identify inter-aquifer connectivity, multiple isotopes (delta H-2, delta O-18, Sr-87/Sr-86, H-3 and C-14) were used in this study in conjunction with a comprehensive hydrochemical assessment, based on data collected 6 months after severe flooding in 2011. The relatively depleted stable isotope signatures of the flood-generating rainfall (delta H-2: -30.2 to -27.8 parts per thousand, delta O-18: -5.34 to 5.13 parts per thousand VSMOW) were evident in surface water samples (delta H-2: -25.2 to -23.2 parts per thousand, delta O-18: -3.9 to -3.6 parts per thousand VSMOW), indicating that these extreme events were a major source of recharge to the dam in the catchment headwaters. Furthermore, stable isotopes confirmed that the flood generated significant recharge to the alluvium in the lower part of the catchment, particularly in areas where interactions between surface waters and groundwater were identified and where diffuse aquifer recharge is normally limited by a thick (approximately 10 m) and relatively impermeable unsaturated zone. However, in the upper parts of the catchment where recharge generally occurs more rapidly due to the dominance of coarse-grained sediments in the unsaturated zone, the stable isotope signature of groundwater resembles the longer-term average rainfall values (delta H-2: -12.6, delta O-18: -3.4 parts per thousand VSMOW), highlighting that recharge was sourced from smaller rainfall events that occurred subsequent to the flooding. Interactions between the bedrock aquifers and the alluvium were identified at several sites in the lower part of the catchment based on Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios; this was also supported by the hydrochemical assessment, which included the modelling of evaporation trends and saturation indices. The integrated approach used in this study facilitated the identification of hydrological processes over different spatial and temporal scales, and the method can be applied to other complex geological settings with variable climatic conditions.

TI Temporal variations in the dissolved nutrient stocks in the surface
   water of the western North Atlantic Ocean
SO JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Changes in patterns of undetectability and molar ratios of dissolved nutrients in the euphotic zone of the oligotrophic western North Atlantic Ocean were investigated utilizing the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) data set of the US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS). Our aim was to examine the temporal dynamics of nutrient stocks over a decade (1989similar to1998) and to gain insight into the interactions between the different biotic and abiotic factors underlying BATS. Patterns of nutrient undetectability clearly revealed the depleted nature of the nutrients in surface water at the BATS location, particularly phosphorous. The N:P ratio was consistently far above the nominal Redfield ratio (mean, 38.5) but was significantly lower during the 1993similar to1994 period (22.1). Over the same period the proportion of samples depleted in N only increased while the proportion of samples depleted in P only decreased. This indicates an overall reduction of N relative to P in the surface water at BATS during the 1993similar to1994 period, the reasons for this anomaly, though, are not clear. The correlation analysis between the biotic and abiotic variables at BATS has indicated some interesting relationships that can help understand some of the parameters affecting nutrient stocks in the euphotic zone and their consequent impacts on marine biota. Although nutrient stocks in the oligotrophic environment are limited, they might be subject to interannual variation that may become anomalous in some cases. These variations might underlay significant feedback mechanisms by affecting marine productivity, the prime factor controlling the sequestration of atmospheric CO2 by the oceans.

TI Desert in Bengal Delta-Changes in Landscape, Changes in Livelihood: Can
   Diffusion and Adoption of Sustainable Adaptation Make a Difference?
SO CASES ON THE DIFFUSION AND ADOPTION OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES
AB This study is aimed to assess the impacts of various climate induced events and the sustainability of adoption of coping and adaptive measures against these impacts. The study was conducted through participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and focus group discussion (FGD) in three sites of Kalapara Upazila (Sub-district), located along the Bay of Bengal in Southwest Bangladesh. Finding suggests that although flooding, cyclones, storm surges, and seasonal droughts have different attributes, they have commonality in bringing severe salinity in soil, sub-soil water, and surface water bodies that severely affects the livelihood security of natural resource-dependent coastal population. Indigenous knowledge and diffusion of vernacular technologies have helped a large majority of people to adopt various coping and adaptation strategies against the salinity problem for long. However, in a changing nature of salinity (i.e. a discrete isolated event has been turning to a perpetual event), which is resulting from climate change induced sea level rise (CC-SLR), most of their adopted coping and adaptation measures have failed to address their livelihood security on a sustained basis. To bolster their efforts toward adoption of adaptation strategies for sustainable livelihood, a range of avenues for interventions are identified.

TI A long-term dataset of lake surface water temperature over the Tibetan
   Plateau derived from AVHRR 1981-2015
SO SCIENTIFIC DATA
AB Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is of vital importance for hydrological and meteorological studies. The LSWT ground measurements in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) were quite scarce because of its harsh environment. Thermal infrared remote sensing is a reliable way to calculate historical LSWT. In this study, we present the first and longest 35-year (1981-2015) daytime lake-averaged LSWT data of 97 large lakes (>80 km(2) each) in the TP using the 4-km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Area Coverage (GAC) data. The LSWT dataset, taking advantage of observations from NOAA's afternoon satellites, includes three time scales, i.e., daily, 8-day-averaged, and monthly-averaged. The AVHRR-derived LSWT has a similar accuracy (RMSE = 1.7 degrees C) to that from other data products such as MODIS (RMSE = 1.7 degrees C) and ARC-Lake (RMSE = 2.0 degrees C). An inter-comparison of different sensors indicates that for studies such as those considering long-term climate change, the relative bias of different AVHRR sensors cannot be ignored. The proposed dataset should be, to some extent, a valuable asset for better understanding the hydrologic/climatic property and its changes over the TP.

TI Filter Media for Nutrient Removal in Natural Systems and Built
   Environments: I-Previous Trends and Perspectives
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
AB High nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in stormwater runoff, contaminated groundwater, landfill leachate, and domestic and industrial wastewater effluents have aggravated groundwater and surface water contamination and hindered the potential of water reuse. Elevated nutrient levels in groundwater and surface water systems may cause public health problems and may impair or destroy environmentally sensitive ecosystem habitats. Multiple pollutants with cotreatment strategies have not yet been fully developed. Design philosophy is evolving to fit versatile application needs with the most cost-effective way to ensure environmental compliance. These nutrients can actually be reduced or even removed to a large extent by using a filter or sorption media mixture throughout the applications of low-impact development and best management practices. The objective of this critical and thorough literature review was to provide a comprehensive realization of the use of sorption media mixtures for nutrient removal in a number of major environmental engineering disciplines. Classification of the disciplinary applications at a practical level provides some viewpoints of the trends and perspectives along this endeavor in the nexus of materials science, sustainable engineering, and green infrastructure.

TI Trace organic chemicals contamination in ground water recharge
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Population growth and unpredictable climate changes will pose high demands on water resources in the future. Even at present, surface water is certainly not enough to cope with the water requirement for agricultural, industrial, recreational and drinking purposes. In this context, the usage of ground water has become essential, therefore, their quality and quantity has to be carefully managed. Regarding quantity, artificial recharge can guarantee a sustainable level of ground water, whilst the strict quality control of the waters intended for recharge will minimize contamination of both the ground water and aquifer area. However, all water resources in the planet are threatened by multiple sources of contamination coming from the extended use of chemicals worldwide. In this respect, the environmental occurrence of organic micropollutants such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals and their metabolites has experienced fast growing interest.
   In this paper an overview of the priority and emerging organic micropollutants in the different source waters used for artificial aquifer recharge purposes and in the recovered water is presented. Besides, some considerations regarding fate and removal of such compounds are also addressed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of climate change on Mediterranean marine ecosystems: the case
   of the Catalan Sea
SO CLIMATE RESEARCH
AB The Catalan Sea, located between the eastern Iberian coast and the Balearic Islands, is a representative portion of the western Mediterranean basin and provides a valuable case study for climate change effects on Mediterranean ecosystems. Global warming is reflected regionally by a rise in sea level over the last century, an increase in surface temperature of around 1.1 degrees C in the last 35 yr, a progressive salinisation of intermediate and deep waters and a strengthening of the stratification. A likely scenario of what we can expect in the Mediterranean Sea is a considerable decrease in rainfall and wind, warmer surface waters and a prolonged stratification period. The effects on Mediterranean ecosystems are evident in: (1) a meridionalisation of the algal, invertebrate and vertebrate species, which favours the more thermophilic species over the temperate species; (2) mass mortality events of sessile invertebrates of the coralligenous communities owing to anomalous warm waters during the period when food is scarce; (3) increases in the smallest phytoplankton due to the prolongation of the water stratification period; (4) proliferation of gelatinous carnivores, including jellyfish, due to the temperature rise and the lack of rainfall; (5) a faster acidification of seawater, compared with the global oceans, accompanied by a decrease in the capacity to absorb atmospheric CO2. In order to anticipate and mitigate these predicted changes, we recommend investing in research and observation, conserving areas that serve as indicators of climate change and reducing other anthropogenic pressures such as habitat destruction, overfishing or pollution, which may act synergistically to accelerate these changes.

TI Groundwater and Surface Water Interaction at the Regional-scale - A
   Review with Focus on Regional Integrated Models
SO WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB Scientists and practitioners agree that integrated water resource management is necessary, with an increasing need for research at the regional scale (10(3) to 10(5) km(2)). At this scale interactions between environmental and human systems are fully developed and global change is linked to local actions. The groundwater-surface water interaction (GW-SW) is of particular interest. Herein we review the scientific journal literature and examine GW-SW at the regional scale. We briefly review all existing literature on GW-SW, then summarise its characteristics at different scales and identify specific challenges of the regional scale. We explore whether GW-SW should be treated differently at regional and local scales. Regional GW-SW is rarely examined in experimental field studies, which almost exclusively cover small areas. However, GW-SW is often integral to large scale coupled models. Thus, we collate information about existing models and their regional applications. Fully coupled, physics-based models have great potential to meet the technical challenges. However, limited data availability hampers the application of complex models at the regional scale and loosely coupled schemes are more widely applied. Many integrated modelling concepts have been published, but none have been applied in a wide range of settings. Thus, it is impossible to compare the performance of different approaches. Comparative analyses of existing regional scale integrated models in the context of different data availability and geographic conditions are needed. Unfortunately, peer-reviewed journal literature no longer provides a representative picture of the subject as models are becoming "too big to be published" or too pragmatic.

TI Evaluation of WEAP-MODFLOW Model as an Integrated Water Resources
   Management Model for Sustainable Development (A Case Study: Gharesoo at
   Doab-Merek, Kermanshah, Iran)
SO CIVIL ENGINEERING INFRASTRUCTURES JOURNAL-CEIJ
AB This paper evaluated an integrated water resources management approach through linked WEAP-MODFLOW model. Study area is Ravasnar-Sanjabi plain located in Kermanshah province in the west of Iran. A MODFLOW model was evaluated and then, accepted as a groundwater model for the region in present research. Schematic WEAP model was provided as representing general features of water resources system after designing a conceptual model for the study area. The simplified rainfall-runoff model in WEAP was used to perform hydrological simulations. In the second step of present research, the groundwater model was linked to WEAP dynamically. Simulation years with 12 time steps per year included years of 2007-2015 for creating and verifying WEAP-MODFLOW model and years of 2015-2030 for performing scenarios. Statistical criteria included mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe (NASH), with Box plot diagram being selected to assess accuracy of calibrated model. Four scenarios were implemented for 2015 until 2030. They included unchanged present situation and situations with 35%, 45% and 57% reduction of groundwater and surface water withdrawal. Results showed that the fourth scenario with a 57% decrease in the extraction of surface water and groundwater resources was the best one. Based on this scenario, exploitation of the system will be sustainable, with the system recovering as 0.023 meter rising per year. Finally, the results of present study indicated that the approach was feasible for planning and managing water resources in spite of the lack of some data.

TI Floating microplastics in a coastal embayment: A multifaceted issue
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB Floating microplastic debris at the ocean's surface represents about 1% of all plastics found in the environment, with the remainder thought to be either deposited along the coast or sinks to the bottom of the ocean. This exploratory research on a coastal embayment in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean assesses floating microplastic densities and the potential influence of wind. A total of 1182 floating microplastic particles were retrieved from a total surface seawater volume of 2039.86 m(3). The average microplastic density (0.56 +/- 0.33 MP m(-3)) is based on a sample of 20 manta trawls. This study reports primary microplastics (microbeads) floating in Irish coastal waters for the first-time. Compared to similar bays in Europe, Galway Bay has a similar microplastic density range. Microplastics in surface waters are a multifaceted issue therefore, multiple types of sample collection along with associated environmental variables are recommended for coastal monitoring purposes.

TI History and evolution of seepage meters for quantifying flow between
   groundwater and surface water: Part 2-Marine settings and submarine
   groundwater discharge
SO EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB This review of studies that quantified fluxes with seepage meters in marine settings in the last decades shows the historical evolution of this device and the knowledge acquired during this period. Coastal environments are differentiated from freshwater settings due to water salinity and the effects of fides and waves that have important implications for the measurement approach and generated results. The framework in which seepage meters have been used in marine settings has evolved in parallel to the understanding of submarine groundwater discharge. This review of seepage meter research shows: an uneven distribution of studies in the world with some densely-studied regions and an absolute lack of data in other regions; a dominance of studies where only seepage meters were used compared to studies that combined seepage meter measurements with values determined with radioactive tracers or hydraulic calculations; and a variety of publication outlets with different focuses (hydrology, oceanography or multidisciplinary). The historical overview of the research conducted with seepage meters shows the wide range of seepage meter applications - from simply measuring fluxes at local scales to larger studies that extrapolate local results to estimate fluxes of water, nutrients, and other solutes at regional and global scales. A variety of automated seepage meters have been developed and used to better characterize short-term groundwater-seawater exchange, including the effects of waves and fides. We present recommendations and considerations to guide seepage meter deployment in marine settings, as seepage meters are still the only method that quantifies directly the interaction between groundwater and surface water.

TI Large-scale sensitivities of groundwater and surface water to
   groundwater withdrawal
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB Increasing population, economic growth and changes in diet have dramatically increased the demand for food and water over the last decades. To meet increasing demands, irrigated agriculture has expanded into semi-arid areas with limited precipitation and surface water availability. This has greatly intensified the dependence of irrigated crops on groundwater withdrawal and caused a steady increase in groundwater withdrawal and groundwater depletion. One of the effects of groundwater pumping is the reduction in streamflow through capture of groundwater recharge, with detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems. The degree to which groundwater withdrawal affects streamflow or groundwater storage depends on the nature of the groundwater-surface water interaction (GWSI). So far, analytical solutions that have been derived to calculate the impact of groundwater on streamflow depletion involve single wells and streams and do not allow the GWSI to shift from connected to disconnected, i.e. from a situation with two-way interaction to one with a one-way interaction between groundwater and surface water. Including this shift and also analysing the effects of many wells requires numerical groundwater models that are expensive to set up. Here, we introduce an analytical framework based on a simple lumped conceptual model that allows us to estimate to what extent groundwater withdrawal affects groundwater heads and streamflow at regional scales. It accounts for a shift in GWSI, calculates at which critical withdrawal rate such a shift is expected, and when it is likely to occur after withdrawal commences. It also provides estimates of streamflow depletion and which part of the groundwater withdrawal comes out of groundwater storage and which parts from a reduction in streamflow. After a local sensitivity analysis, the framework is combined with parameters and inputs from a global hydrological model and subsequently used to provide global maps of critical withdrawal rates and timing, the areas where current withdrawal exceeds critical limits and maps of groundwater and streamflow depletion rates that result from groundwater withdrawal. The resulting global depletion rates are compared with estimates from in situ observations and regional and global groundwater models and satellites. Pairing of the analytical framework with more complex global hydrological models presents a screening tool for fast first-order assessments of regional-scale groundwater sustainability and for supporting hydro-economic models that require simple relationships between groundwater withdrawal rates and the evolution of pumping costs and environmental externalities.

TI International approaches to the hydraulic control of surface water
   runoff in mitigating flood and environmental risks

CL Lyon, FRANCE
AB This paper compares and contrasts a number of international approaches to the hydraulic control of surface water runoff from new development and redevelopment, known as sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) or low impact development (LID). The paper provides a commentary on the progress and current status of national standards for SuDS in the UK to control the frequency, flow rate and volume of runoff from both frequent and extreme rainfall events, and the best practice design criteria presented in the revised UK CIRIA SuDS Manual, published in November 2015. The paper then compares these design criteria and standards with those developed and applied in China, USA, France and Germany and also looks at the drivers behind their development. The benefits of these different approaches are assessed in the context of flood risk mitigation, climate resilience and wider environmental protection objectives, including water quality, morphology and ecology. The paper also reviews the design approaches promoted by the new SuDS Manual and internationally for delivering additional benefits for urban spaces (such as recreation, visual character, education and economic growth) through multi-functional urban design.

TI Non-nutritive artificial sweeteners as an emerging contaminant in
   environment: A global review and risks perspectives
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB Generally, non-nutritive artificial sweeteners are widely utilized as sugar substitute in various applications. With various applications, non-nutritive artificial sweeteners are now being recognized as emerging contaminants with high water persistence and are chemically stable in environment. Although non-nutritive artificial sweeteners were documented on their occurrence in environment, yet their potential impacts to environment and human health remain ambiguous. Therefore, this review was prepared to provide a more comprehensive insight of non-nutritive artificial sweeteners in environment matrixes by highlighting special concerns on human health and environmental risks. Precisely, this review monitors the exploration of non-nutritive artificial sweeteners occurrences as an emerging contaminants in environment worldwide and their associated risks to human as well as environment. At present, there are a total of 24 non-nutritive artificial sweeteners' studies with regards to their occurrence in the environment from 38 locations globally, spanning across Europe including United Kingdoms, Canada, United States and Asia. Overall, the quantitative findings suggested that the occurrence of non-nutritive artificial sweeteners is present in surface water, tap water, groundwater, seawater, lakes and atmosphere. Among these environmental matrixes, surface water was found as the most studied matrix involving non-nutritive artificial sweeteners. However, findings on non-nutritive artificial sweeteners impacts on human health and environment are limited to understanding its overall potential impacts and risks. Additionally, this review also serves as a framework for future monitoring plans and environmental legislative to better control these emerging contaminants in environment.

TI Paleoclimate and ecology of Cretaceous continental ecosystems of Japan
   inferred from the stable oxygen and carbon isotope compositions of
   vertebrate bioapatite
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB We investigated the environmental conditions that prevailed in continental ecosystems recorded in sedimentary deposits of Japan during the Cretaceous through the analysis of oxygen and carbon isotope compositions phosphate (delta O-18(p)) and apatite-bound carbonate (delta O-18(c) and delta C-13(c)) of vertebrate teeth and bones. Local surface water delta O-18(w) values were calculated using known phosphate-water isotope fractionation equations. Anomalously low delta O-18(w) values of local waters strongly suggest a significant contribution of high-altitude precipitation from nearby mountains to local surface waters. Mean air temperatures were estimated using a global meteoric water delta O-18(mw) value - Mean Annual Air Temperature relationship, and compared to surface water temperatures estimated from fish apatite delta O-18(p) values. Local mean annual precipitations (MAP) were estimated using the known relationship existing between MAP and C3 plant delta C-13(p) value, the latter being calculated using apatite-diet C-13 enrichment applied to plant-eating sauropod and ornithopod dinosaur delta C-13(c) values. Reconstructed environmental conditions suggest that climate changed from cool temperate to warm temperate, being relatively cold and dry during the Late Hauterivian and Barremian to warmer and seasonally more humid during the Aptian and Albian, and even warmer during the Cenomanian-Coniacian. Proposed thermal evolution during the Early Cretaceous is compatible with the absence of thermophilic taxa such as crocodylomorphs before the Aptian in the fossil record of Japan.

TI A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of extreme weather
   events and other weather-related variables on Cryptosporidium and
   Giardia in fresh surface waters
SO JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH
AB Global climate change is expected to impact drinking water quality through multiple weather-related phenomena. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between various weather-related variables and the occurrence and concentration of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in fresh surface waters. We implemented a comprehensive search in four databases, screened 1,228 unique citations for relevance, extracted data from 107 relevant articles, and conducted random-effects meta-analysis on 16 key relationships. The average odds of identifying Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts in fresh surface waters was 2.61 (95% CI = 1.63-4.21; I-2 = 16%) and 2.87 (95% CI = 1.76-4.67; I-2 = 0%) times higher, respectively, during and after extreme weather events compared to baseline conditions. Similarly, the average concentration of Cryptosporidium and Giardia identified under these conditions was also higher, by approximately 4.38 oocysts/100 L (95% CI = 2.01-9.54; I-2 = 0%) and 2.68 cysts/100 L (95% CI = 1.08-6.55; I-2 = 48%). Correlation relationships between other weather-related parameters and the density of these pathogens were frequently heterogeneous and indicated low to moderate effects. Meta-regression analyses identified different study-level factors that influenced the variability in these relationships. The results can be used as direct inputs for quantitative microbial risk assessment. Future research is warranted to investigate these effects and potential mitigation strategies in different settings and contexts.

TI Surface water quality in Amazonian Floodplain Lakes, data set of the
   Lago Grande de Curuai Floodplain Lake, Para-Brazil
SO GEOSCIENCE DATA JOURNAL
AB Between 2013 and 2017, we carried out nine field missions in the Lago Grande de Curuai floodplain, located in Para state - North of Brazil - to collect samples for monitoring surface water quality. This site separated from the river by a narrow bank is composed of a network of channels and shallow lakes, a morphology shared by the floodplains of the lower Amazon. A multiparameter probe was used in situ to measure electrical conductivity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, turbidity, depth and a Secchi disk to estimate transparency. Water grab samples were analysed for suspended material, alkalinity, humic acid, phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon and chlorophyll. Sampling stations were distributed over the seven larger lakes in the floodplain and sampled at different periods of the hydrological cycle. The number of samples varied with the floodplain water level, with a minimum of 25 samples for each field visit. This data set is a collection of water quality data to assist in the limnological or biogeochemical studies of surface waters in Amazonian floodplain lakes, and the product of successive French-Brazilian projects: (1) the Clim-FABIAM 'Climate changes and Floodplain lake biodiversity in the Amazon Basin: how to cope and help the ecological and economic sustainability' funded by the French Foundation for biodiversity research (FRB), (2) the project Bloom-ALERT -'Environmental sensitivity and population health vulnerability to cyanobacteria in the Amazon: towards shared indicators' funded by the French-Brazilian research program GUYAMAZON 2014, and the project (3) 'Ecossistemas das varzeas e biodiversidade: Impactos das mudancas ambientais e climaticas considerando cenarios de desenvolvimento sustentaveis' (Project number 490634/2013-3) funded by the Brazilian National scientific Research Council CNPq.

TI Microplastic pollution in mangroves and beaches of the Cispata marine
   protected area, Colombian Caribbean Coast
SO REVMAR-REVISTA CIENCIAS MARINAS Y COSTERAS
AB Microplastics are emerging pollutants with a wide global distribution posing a risk to biodiversity and the livelihood of human communities. These particles are mostly transported by rivers from the inland to the marine-coastal ecosystems, where they accumulate and affect their environmental quality. The aim of this study was to evaluate microplastic pollution in mangroves and beaches of the Cispata marine protected area, Colombian Caribbean coast. In May 2018, three stations in the mangroves and two stations on the tourist beaches were selected, where microplastics were sampled in surface water and sediments, as well as visually identified under a stereoscope, counted to determine their abundance, and classified according to their shapes. Microplastic was more abundant in mangroves (from 13 to 123 items/m3 of water; from 72 to 1 668 items/m2 or from 42 to 1 825 items/kg of sediment) compared to beaches (from 0 to 0.13 items/m3 of water; from 8 to 36 items/m2 of sediment). In both ecosystems, films, foams, and fragments were the most common shapes, being related to deficient management of domestic waste, tourism, and fishing in the area. This study contributes to the knowledge of microplastic characteristics, distribution, and abundance in mangroves and beaches in the region in order to raise environmental awareness about the risks and promote actions to prevent and mitigate the negative impacts, especially in marine protected areas.

TI Environmental evaluation of high-value agricultural produce with diverse
   water sources: case study from Southern California
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Meeting agricultural demand in the face of a changing climate will be one of the major challenges of the 21st century. California is the single largest agricultural producer in the United States but is prone to extreme hydrologic events, including multi-year droughts. Ventura County is one of California's most productive growing regions but faces water shortages and deteriorating water quality. The future of California's agriculture is dependent on our ability to identify and implement alternative irrigation water sources and technologies. Two such alternative water sources are recycled and desalinated water. The proximity of high-value crops in Ventura County to both dense population centers and the Pacific Ocean makes it a prime candidate for alternative water sources. This study uses highly localized spatial and temporal data to assess life-cycle energy use, life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions, operational costs, applied water demand, and on-farm labor requirements for four high-value crops. A complete switch from conventional irrigation with groundwater and surface water to recycled water would increase the life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with strawberry, lemon, celery, and avocado production by approximately 14%, 7%, 59%, and 9%, respectively. Switching from groundwater and surface water to desalinated water would increase life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 33%, 210%, 140%, and 270%, respectively. The use of recycled or desalinated water for irrigation is most financially tenable for strawberries due to their relatively high value and close proximity to water treatment facilities. However, changing strawberry packaging has a greater potential impact on life-cycle energy use and greenhouse gas emissions than switching the water source. While this analysis does not consider the impact of water quality on crop yields, previous studies suggest that switching to recycled water could result in significant yield increases due to its lower salinity.

TI ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF POLICY RESTRICTIONS ON WATER WITHDRAWALS FROM
   SURFACE AND UNDERGROUND SOURCES
SO ECONOMIC SYSTEMS RESEARCH
AB The appropriation of water for economic activities is limited by regional surface and underground endowments, and symptoms of environmentally unsustainable withdrawals are already visible in many regions of the world. In this paper we investigate the economic implications of water policy imposing source- and region-specific restrictions on water withdrawals taking the Mexican economy as a case study. We use an inter-regional input-output model of Mexico's hydro-economic regions to allocate production subject to the availability of water and other factors of production. Water sustainability requires a reduction of 7.5 km(3)/yr of groundwater withdrawals, which is compensated by an increase of 3.4 km(3)/yr of surface water, an expansion onto an additional 1.4 million hectares of rainfed land, and modifications in subnational patterns of food trade. This framework for evaluating scenarios describing sustainability-oriented water policies is readily applicable to other regions.

TI Human recreational exposure to antibiotic resistant bacteria in coastal
   bathing waters
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) are associated with poor health outcomes and are recognised globally as a serious health problem. Much research has been conducted on the transmission of ARB to humans. Yet the role the natural environment plays in the spread of ARB and antibiotic resistance genes is not well understood. Antibiotic resistant bacteria have been detected in natural aquatic environments, and ingestion of seawater during water sports is one route by which many people could be directly exposed. The aim was to estimate the prevalence of resistance to one clinically important class of antibiotics (thirdgeneration cephalosporins (3GC5)) amongst Escherichia coil in coastal surface waters in England and Wales. Prevalence data was used to quantify ingestion of 3GC-resistant E. coil (3GCREC) by people participating in water sports in designated coastal bathing waters. A further aim was to use this value to derive a populationlevel estimate of exposure to these bacteria during recreational use of coastal waters in 2012.
   The prevalence of 3GC-resistance amongst E. coil isolated from coastal surface waters was estimated using culture-based methods. This was combined with the density of E. coli reported in designated coastal bathing waters along with estimations of the volumes of water ingested during various water sports reported in the literature to calculate the mean number of 3GCREC ingested during different water sports.
   0.12% of E. coli isolated from surface waters were resistant to 3GCs. This value was used to estimate that in England and Wales over 6.3 million water sport sessions occurred in 2012 that resulted in the ingestion of at least one 3GCREC.
   Despite the low prevalence of resistance to 3GC5 amongst E. coil in surface waters, there is an identifiable human exposure risk for water users, which varies with the type of water sport undertaken. The relative importance of this exposure is likely to be greater in areas where a large proportion of the population enjoys water sports. Millions of water sport sessions occurred in 2012 that were likely to have resulted in people ingesting E. coli resistant to a single class of antibiotics (3GC5). However, this is expected to be a significant underestimate of recreational exposure to all ARE in seawater.
   This is the first study to use volumes of water ingested during different water sports to estimate human exposure to ARB. Further work needs to be done to elucidate the health implications and clinical relevance of exposure to ARE in both marine and fresh waters in order to fully understand the risk to public health.

TI Climate-warming-driven changes in the cryosphere and their impact
   ongroundwater-surface-water interactions in the Heihe River basin
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB The Heihe River basin in northwest China depends heavily on both anthropogenic and natural storage (e.g., surface reservoirs, rivers and groundwater) to support economic and environmental functions. The Qilian Mountain cryosphere in the upper basin is integral to recharging these storage supplies. It is well established that climate warming is driving major shifts in high-elevation water storage through loss of glaciers and permafrost. However, the impacts on groundwater-surface-water interactions and water supply in corresponding lower reaches are less clear. We built an integrated hydrologic model of the middle basin, where most water usage occurs, in order to explore the hydrologic response to the changing cryosphere. We simulate the watershed response to loss of glaciers (glacier scenario), advanced permafrost degradation (permafrost scenario), both of these changes simultaneously (combined scenario) and projected temperature increases in the middle basin (warming scenario) by altering streamflow inputs to the model to represent cryosphere-melting processes, as well as by increasing the temperature of the climate forcing data. Net losses to groundwater storage in the glacier scenario and net gains in the permafrost and combined scenarios show the potential of groundwater exchanges to mediate streamflow shifts. The result of the combined scenario also shows that permafrost degradation has more of an impact on the system than glacial loss. Seasonal differences in groundwater-surface-water partitioning are also evident. The glacier scenario has the highest fraction of groundwater in terms of streamflow in early spring. The permafrost and combined scenarios meanwhile have the highest fraction of streamflow infiltration in late spring and summer. The warming scenario raises the temperature of the combined scenario by 2 degrees C. This results in net groundwater storage loss, a reversal from the combined scenario. Large seasonal changes in evapotranspiration and stream network connectivity relative to the combined scenario show the potential for warming to overpower changes resulting from streamflow. Our results demonstrate the importance of understanding the entire system of groundwater-surface-water exchanges to assess water resources under changing climatic conditions. Ultimately, this analysis can be used to examine the cascading impact of climate change in the cryosphere on the resilience of water resources in arid basins downstream of mountain ranges globally.

TI UNPLANNED URBANIZATION AND ASSOCIATED RISK ON HUMAN EXPOSURE AND
   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT: A CASE STUDY
SO IMPACT, MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
SE Pollution Science Technology and Abatement
AB Unplanned urbanization leads to environmental degradation. Some emergency planning policies in the Sylhet urban area have been taken by the government. It is seen that a considerable part of the concerned area is classified as a high-risk zone and some parts are classified as very high-risk zones. It is also found that about half of the population (55.22%) is considered a very high-risk zone and this constitutes about 51.29% of total area. Again, 44.78% of population is living in the rest area (48.71%) having high-risk exposure due to existing surface water quality. It can be concluded that if the surface water of the Sylhet Municipality is being used as the source of the water supply system then it should be treated to a high degree of treatment. Detailed study will help in making a sustainable urban plan and will also pave the way to improving the situation.

TI Changes in soil and water quality at sediment-water interface of Penaeus
   vannamei culture pond at varying salinities
SO AQUACULTURE RESEARCH
AB The health of the pond environment in shrimp farming is important for sustainable and profitable aquaculture, in which sediment-water interface is the most important influencing area. With this objective, the key parameters of water and sediment at the interface was studied in shrimp ponds with varying salinities and compared with the surface water and soil to understand the variations and the underlying causes. Total ammonia nitrogen and total alkalinity were higher in water at the interface as compared to surface water, whereas pH, nitrite, oxide forms of nitrogen (NO3), phosphorus (PO4) and oxidizing bacteria were observed to be lower. There was no significant difference with respect to macrominerals such as sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium between water at the interface and surface. These changes are profoundly influenced by the uppermost 1.0-cm thick sediment layer, where the maximum transition of nutrients takes place with the water column. The outcome of the study highlights the effectiveness of water sampling for metabolites at the interface, which reflects at an early stage any potential deterioration of pond environment, which will help the farmer to initiate timely mitigation measures.

TI Impact of Natural and Anthropogenic Stresses on Surface and Groundwater
   Supply Sources of the Upper Awash Sub-Basin, Central Ethiopia
SO FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
AB Improving water security is critical to delivering the best outcomes for development. In Ethiopia, the upper Awash sub-basin supports expanding urban and industrial areas, with increasing water demands. Studies have preferentially focused either on surface water hydrology or on groundwater characterization. However, novel tools are required to support the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater for competing users under potential climate change impacts. In this paper, we present research based on a WEAP-MODFLOW link configured for four catchments in the upper Awash sub-basin (Akaki, Melka Kunture, Mojo, and Koka). The Akaki catchment supplies water for Addis Ababa city. Unlike most surface water hydrological models, both supply (surface water and groundwater) and demand (domestic, industrial, and livestock) are modeled. The tool was used to evaluate the impacts of population growth, leakage, expansion of surface and groundwater supply schemes, and climate change scenarios up to the year 2030. Considering the high population growth rate scenario for Addis Ababa city, the unmet domestic water demand may increase to 760 MCM in 2030. Water leakage through poor water supply distribution networks contributed about 23% of the unmet water demand. Though not significant compared with population and water loss stresses, climate change also affect the supply demand condition in the basin. Planning for more groundwater abstraction without considering additional surface water reservoir schemes will noticeably impact the groundwater resource, with groundwater levels projected to decline by more than 20 m. Even more groundwater level decline is observed In the Akaki catchment, where Addis Ababa city is located. Conjunctive use of surface and groundwater not only boosts the supply demand situation in the basin but will lift off some of the stresses from the groundwater resources. Even under the likely increase in temperature and low precipitation climate scenarios, the conjunctive use resulted in a significant increase in domestic water demand coverage from 26% for the reference condition to 90% in 2030, with minimum effect on the groundwater resources. To improve water security conditions through sustainable utilization of both surface and groundwater resources, policy responses need to consider surface and groundwater conjunctive use. Minimizing water leakage should also be given the highest priority.

TI Screening of pharmaceuticals and hormones at the regional scale, in
   surface and groundwaters intended to human consumption
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB As part of a regional screening to evaluate the risk, for the health of populations, to certain classes of emerging substances, several families of pharmaceuticals and hormones were looked for in waters intended to drinking. Thus, 52 substances were investigated in 71 surface waters and 70 groundwaters. Results indicate that no water was free of pollutants, regardless of its origin (surface or groundwater) and the season of collect. The pharmaceuticals most frequently detected and with the highest concentration levels were salicylic acid, carbamazepine and acetaminophen. Among hormones, testosterone, androstenedione and progesterone were detected in almost all the samples. Globally the groundwaters were less contaminated than surface waters in regards pharmaceuticals frequencies and levels. On the other side, androgens and progestagens were present with comparable frequencies and levels in both compartments. The risk linked to the presence of these substances on human health is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Risk of post-fire metal mobilization into surface water resources: A
   review
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB One of the significant economic benefits to communities around the world of having pristine forest catchments is the supply of substantial quantities of high quality potable water. This supports a saving of around US$ 4.1 trillion per year globally by limiting the cost of expensive drinking water treatments and provision of unnecessary infrastructure. Even low levels of contaminants specifically organics and metals in catchments when in a mobile state can reduce these economic benefits by seriously affecting the water quality. Contamination and contaminant mobility can occur through natural and anthropogenic activities including forest fires. Moderate to high intensity forest fires are able to alter soil properties and release sequestered metals from sediments, soil organic matter and fragments of vegetation. In addition, the increase in post-fire erosion rate by rainfall runoff and strong winds facilitates the rapid transport of these metals downslope and downstream. The subsequent metal deposition in distal soil and water bodies can influence surface water quality with potential impacts to the larger ecosystems inclusive of negative effects on humans. This is of substantial concern as 4 billion hectares of forest catchments provide high quality water to global communities. Redressing this problem requires quantification of the potential effects on water resources and instituting rigorous fire and environmental management plans to mitigate deleterious effects on catchment areas. This paper is a review of the current state of,the art literature dealing with the risk of post-fire mobilization of the metals into surface water resources. It is intended to inform discussion on the preparation of suitable management plans and policies during and after fire events in order to maintain potable water quality in a cost-effective manner. In these times of climate fluctuation and increased incidence of fires, the need for development of new policies and management frameworks are of heighted significance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The main sources of pollution of surface waters are untreated or insufficiently treated household and industry wastewater; meteoric and other waters from polluted air basin which are polluting the surface waters with a wide range of various pollutants, thus violating their ecobalance. They can contain toxic matters that are difficult to identify and the harmful affect of which are not yet studied.
   Having a good understanding of the above statements, still, the unsparing operation of water facilities goes on, thus irreversibly changing their natural rotation with different pollutants. Maintenance of the ecobalance of surface waters is a critical problem that requires an immediate solution. Use of wastewater for irrigation purposes can partially solve the problem; it involves more targeted use of the scarce stock of fresh water, while at the same time ensuring reliable supply of water rich in nutritients for farmers. Such exchange has also a positive environmental effect since it leads to decrease in wastewater runoff to the natural waters as well as to accumulation of nutrients contained in wastewater in soil.
   Currently, use of wastewater is largely practiced throughout the world; and this enables to bring closer the demand existing in different spheres of water use to the existing supply in low-water areas. Motivations for wastewater use are certainly different in developed and developing countries; however the growth in the number of world population, lack of sufficient food, global warming, water scarcity, and the growing level of pollution of the nature are global problems that make the treated water a valuable resource. Therefore, by applying treated wastewaters, not only environmental problems but also problems of household and economic significance are solved.
   The paper considers modernization of water distribution, water quality and standards, legal and institutional framework, and financial mechanisms for the purpose of enhancing the efficiency of wastewater use in agriculture; development of comprehensive planning system for setting up bases for wastewater using process that will enable to determine and clearly present the core standards of management system, identify the problems and clarify the ways for solution thereof, and define the functions of agencies involved in the process.

TI Trace metal in surface water and groundwater and its transfer in a
   Yellow River alluvial fan: Evidence from isotopes and hydrochemistry
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Metals are ubiquitous in the environment. The aim of sustainable management of the agro-ecosystem includes ensuring that water continues to fulfill its function in agricultural production, cycling of elements, and as a habitat of numerous organisms. There is no doubt that the influence of large-scale irrigation projects has impacted the regional surface-groundwater interactions in the North China Plain (NCP). Given these concerns, the aim of this study is to evaluate the pollution, identify the sources of trace metals, analyze the influence of surface-groundwater interactions on trace metal distribution, and to propose urgent management strategies for trace metals in the agriculture area in China. Trace metals, hydrochemical indicators (EC, pH, concentrations of Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, SO24-, and HCO3-) and stable isotopic composition (delta O-18 and delta H-2) were determined for surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) samples. Trace metals were detected in all samples. Concentrations of Fe, Se, B, Mn, and Zn in SW exceeded drinking water standards by 14.8%, 29.6%, 25.9%, 11.1%, and 14.8% higher, respectively, and by 3.8%, 23.1%, 11.5%, 11.5%, and 7.7% in GW. The pollution of trace metals in surface water was more serious than that in groundwater, and was also higher than in common irrigation areas in NCP. Trace metals were found to have a combined origin of geogenic and agriculture and industrial activities. Their distribution varied greatly and exhibited a certain relationship with the water flow direction, with the exception of a number of singular sites. Hydrochemical and environmental isotopic evidence indicates surface-groundwater interactions influence the spatial distribution of trace metal in the study area Facing the ongoing serious pollution, management practices for source control, improved control technologies, and the construction of a monitoring net to warn of increased risk are urgently needed.

TI Systems Analysis Approach to the Design of Efficient Water Pricing
   Policies under the EU Water Framework Directive
SO JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Economic theory suggests that water pricing can contribute to efficient management of water scarcity. The European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive (WFD) is a major legislative effort to introduce the use of economic instruments to encourage efficient water use and achieve environmental management objectives. However, the design and implementation of economic instruments for water management, including water pricing, has emerged as a challenging aspect of WFD implementation. This study demonstrates the use of a systems analysis approach to designing and comparing two economic approaches to efficient management of groundwater and surface water given EU WFD ecological flow requirements. Under the first approach, all wholesale water users in a river basin face the same volumetric price for water. This water price does not vary in space or in time, and surface water and groundwater are priced at the same rate. Under the second approach, surface water is priced using a volumetric price, while groundwater use is controlled through adjustments to the price of energy, which is assumed to control the cost of groundwater pumping. For both pricing policies, optimization is used to identify optimal prices, with the objective of maximizing welfare while reducing human water use in order to meet constraints associated with EU WFD ecological and groundwater sustainability objectives. The systems analysis approach demonstrates the successful integration of economic, hydrologic, and environmental components into an integrated framework for the design and testing of water pricing policies. In comparison to the first pricing policy, the second pricing policy, in which the energy price is used as a surrogate for a groundwater price, shifts a portion of costs imposed by higher water prices from low-value crops to high-value crops and from small urban/domestic locations to larger locations. Because growers of low-value crops will suffer the most from water price increases, the use of energy costs to control groundwater use offers the advantage of reducing this burden.

TI Managing Water and Salt for Sustainable Agriculture in the Indus Basin
   of Pakistan
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The Indus basin of Pakistan occupies about 16 million ha (Mha) of land. The Indus River and its tributaries are the primary sources of surface water. An estimated 122 km(3) of surface water is diverted annually through an extensive canal system to irrigate this land. These surface water supplies are insufficient to meet the crop water requirements for the intensive cropping system practiced in the Indus basin. The shortfall in surface water is met by exploiting groundwater. Currently, about 62 km(3) of groundwater is pumped annually by 1.36 million private and public tube wells. About 1.0 million tubewells are working only in the Punjab province. Small private tubewells account for about 80% of the pumped volume. Inadequate water allocation along the irrigation canals allows excessive water use by head-end farmers, resulting in waterlogging. In contrast, the less productive use of erratic supplies by tail-end farmers often results in soil salinity. The major issues faced by irrigated agriculture in Pakistan are low crop yields and water use efficiency, increasing soil salinization, water quality deterioration, and inefficient drainage effluent disposal. Currently, 4.5 Mha (about 30% of the total irrigated area) suffers from adverse salinity levels. Critical governance issues include inequitable water distribution, minimizing the extent to which salt is mobilized, controlling excessive groundwater pumping, and immediate repair and maintenance of the infrastructure. This paper suggests several options to improve governance, water and salt management to support sustainable irrigated agriculture in Pakistan. In saline groundwater areas, the rotational priorities should be reorganized to match the delivery schedules as closely as possible to crop demand, while emphasizing the reliability of irrigation schedules. Wherever possible, public tubewells should pump fresh groundwater into distributaries to increase water availability at the tail ends. Any substantial reform to make water delivery more flexible and responsive would require an amendment to the existing law and reconfiguration of the entire infrastructure, including thousands of kilometers of channels and almost 60,000 outlets to farmer groups. Within the existing political economy of Pakistan, changing the current water allocation and distribution laws without modernizing the infrastructure would be complicated. A realistic reform program should prioritize interventions that do not require amendment of the Acts or reconstruction of the entire system and are relatively inexpensive. If successful, such interventions may provide the basis for further, more substantial reforms. The present rotational water supply system should continue, with investments focusing on lining channels to ensure equitable water distribution and reduce waterlogging at the head ends. Besides that, the reuse of drainage water should be encouraged to minimize disposal volumes. The timely availability of farm inputs can improve individual farmers' productivity. Farmers will need to have access to new information on improved irrigation management and soil reclamation approaches. Simultaneously, the government should focus more on the management of drainage and salinity.

TI An analysis of the environmental sensitivity of retail filling station
   locations across Europe
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY
AB Releases of hydrocarbon-based fuels at retail filling stations have the potential to affect soil and groundwater and are listed by the European Commission as a potential pressure on achievement of the Water Framework Directive's water quality objectives. This paper presents an analysis of the environmental sensitivity of retail filling station locations across Europe, with regard to proximity to groundwater, surface water and ecological receptors. A geographic information system-based approach was used to map the location of nearly 86 000 retail filling station sites to zones of differing environmental sensitivity. The results indicate that the environmental sensitivity of retail filling stations is highly variable, and that only a relatively small proportion has the potential to cause impact on groundwater abstractions, surface water or to designated ecological receptors. Accordingly, a site-specific risk-based approach to the design and operation of retail filling stations provides the most proportionate and sustainable basis for their management. In addition, the research provides a tool for both single retail filling station operators and the oil industry as a whole to identify areas of higher environmental sensitivity, encouraging the focusing of investment in preventive measures where it is most needed.

TI Sustainability of fresh groundwater resources in fifteen major deltas
   around the world
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Population growth, urbanization and intensification of irrigated agriculture in the world's deltas boost the demand for fresh water, with extensive groundwater extraction as a result. This, in turn, leads to salt water intrusion and upconing, which poses a threat to freshwater and food security. Managing fresh groundwater resources in deltas requires accurate knowledge about the current status and behaviour of their fresh groundwater resources. However, this knowledge is scarcely present, especially for groundwater at larger depths. Here, we use three-dimensional variable-density groundwater model simulations over the last 125 ka to estimate the volume of fresh groundwater resources for 15 major deltas around the world. We estimate current volumes of onshore fresh groundwater resources for individual deltas to vary between 10(10) m(3) and 10(12) m(3). Offshore, the estimated volumes of fresh groundwater are generally smaller, though with a considerably higher variability. In 9 out of 15 simulated deltas, fresh groundwater volumes developed over thousands of years. Based on current groundwater extraction and recharge rates, we estimate the time until in-situ fresh groundwater resources are completely exhausted, partly leading to groundwater level decline and mostly replacement with river water or saline groundwater. This straightforward analysis shows that 4 out of 15 deltas risk complete exhaustion of fresh groundwater resources within 300 m depth in 200 years. These deltas also suffer from saline surface water which means their groundwater resources will progressively salinize. With a fourfold increase in extraction rates, seven deltas risk a complete exhaustion within 200 years. Of these seven deltas, six suffer from saline surface water. We stress that the groundwater of these six vulnerable deltas should be carefully managed, to avoid non-renewable groundwater use. The progressive exhaustion of fresh groundwater resources in these deltas will hamper their ability to withstand periods of water scarcity.

TI Spatial gradients of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in air,
   atmospheric deposition, and surface water of the Ganges River basin
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous semi-volatile organic pollutants. Their environmental occurrence is of global concern as some of them are carcinogens, mutagens, and teratogens. In this study, concentrations and distributions of 16 priority PAHs (Sigma PAHs) were measured in air, atmospheric deposition, and surface water at various locations in Himalayan, Middle, and Lower Reaches of the Ganges River, covering a spatial transect of 2500 km, during two seasons (pre-monsoon and monsoon). The concentration of Sigma PAHs ranged between 2.2 and 182.2 ng m(-3) in air, between 186 and 8810 ng m(-2) day(-1) in atmospheric deposition, and between 0.05 and 65.9 ng L-1 in surface water. Air concentrations were strongly correlated with human population density. In the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Ganges River, atmospheric PAHs were mainly attributed to fossil fuel combustion sources. In the Himalayan Reach the influence of forest fire or biomass combustion was evident during the dry pre-monsoon season. Seasonality in concentrations of PAHs in river water was evident in the Himalayan Reach of the river, as a probable consequence of climate-modulated secondary source intensity (i.e. releases from glacier melting). Seasonality faded in the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Ganges where water contamination is expected to mainly reflect anthropogenic primary sources. Ambient air concentrations were used to calculate the probabilistic incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR). It was expectedly found to be higher in the Middle and Lower Reaches compared to the Himalayan Reach. The strong correlation between population density and air concentrations suggests population density may be used as a surrogate variable to assess human health risk in data-sparse regions such as the Ganges River basin.

TI Modeling 25 years of spatio-temporal surface water and inundation
   dynamics on large river basin scale using time series of Earth
   observation data
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB The usage of time series of Earth observation (EO) data for analyzing and modeling surface water extent (SWE) dynamics across broad geographic regions provides important information for sustainable management and restoration of terrestrial surface water resources, which suffered alarming declines and deterioration globally. The main objective of this research was to model SWE dynamics from a unique, statistically validated Landsat-based time series (1986-2011) continuously through cycles of flooding and drying across a large and heterogeneous river basin, the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) in Australia. We used dynamic linear regression to model remotely sensed SWE as a function of river flow and spatially explicit time series of soil moisture (SM), evapotranspiration (ET), and rainfall (P). To enable a consistent modeling approach across space, we modeled SWE dynamics separately for hydrologically distinct floodplain, floodplain-lake, and non-floodplain areas within eco-hydrological zones and 10km x 10km grid cells. We applied this spatial modeling framework to three sub-regions of the MDB, for which we quantified independently validated lag times between river gauges and each individual grid cell and identified the local combinations of variables that drive SWE dynamics. Based on these automatically quantified flow lag times and variable combinations, SWE dynamics on 233 (64aEuro-%) out of 363 floodplain grid cells were modeled with a coefficient of determination (r(2)) greater than 0.6. The contribution of P, ET, and SM to the predictive performance of models differed among the three sub-regions, with the highest contributions in the least regulated and most arid sub-region. The spatial modeling framework presented here is suitable for modeling SWE dynamics on finer spatial entities compared to most existing studies and applicable to other large and heterogeneous river basins across the world.

TI An evaluation of arsenic contamination status and its potential health
   risk assessment in villages of Nadia and North 24 Parganas, West Bengal,
   India
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The present study was conducted to evaluate the arsenic (As) contamination and possible associated health hazards to exposed population in four villages of two districts (Nadia and North 24 Parganas) of West Bengal, India. The study included two villages each from Nadia (Jaguli and Kugacchi) and North 24 Parganas (Chamta and Byaspur) districts. Groundwater, surface water, soil, rice grains and rice-based food samples were collected from these villages. The results revealed the presence of As in high concentrations in groundwater (35.00 to 186.00 & mu;g L-1), surface water (30.00 to 61.00 & mu;g L-1), soil (46.17 to 66.00 mg kg(-1)), rice grains (0.017 to 1.27 & mu;g g(-1)) and rice-based food products (0.012 to 0.40 & mu;g g(-1)). The maximum As levels were recorded in all types of samples collected from Kugacchi village. The rice grain samples included high-yielding and local varieties, and the level of As in high-yielding varieties was found to be higher (0.72 to 1.27 & mu;g g(-1)) than in local varieties (0.25 to 1.06 & mu;g g(-1)). The data of As concentrations was used for understanding the hazard quotient (HQ) and incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) to the As-exposed population, and significant non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks were revealed considering consumption of rice grains at 400 g per day. The study demonstrates the severity of As contamination in the surveyed villages, which may pose a hindrance to attainment of sustainable development goals (SDGs) by 2030 and proposes the implementation of requisite safety measures.

TI Microplastics' Pollution and Risk Assessment in an Urban River: A Case
   Study in the Yongjiang River, Nanning City, South China
SO EXPOSURE AND HEALTH
AB Microplastics (MPs) have been considered as a global environmental problem threatening the ecological security. However, studies on MPs' pollution in freshwaters and the associated risk assessment remain limited in the literature. In this study, the concentrations, distributions, and the potential ecological risks of MPs were analyzed in Yongjiang River, which is an important drinking water source flowing through Nanning City, the mega city of China. The MPs' abundances in surface waters and sediments ranged from 500 to 7700 n/m(3) and from 90 to 550 n/kg, respectively. Spatial distribution highlighted the significant impact of anthropogenic activity on the MPs' accumulation. Polyethylene and polypropylene were the most common polymer compositions investigated. Shape, size, and color were examined to analyze the characteristics of MPs in the river. To assess the ecological risk of MPs, the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) values were derived from a species' sensitivity distribution model based on the toxicity data of MPs for freshwater species available in the literature. The PNEC for MPs in surface water was derived to be 4920 n/m(3). Risk assessment results through risk quotient (RQ) method suggest that most of the monitored sites in Yongjiang River posed negligible risks to freshwater biota, except the two sites with high risk in the urban center. The results provided a basis for ecological risk assessment of MPs in freshwaters.

TI Occurrence of Pharmaceutically Active Compounds and Potential Ecological
   Risks in Wastewater from Hospitals and Receiving Waters in Sri Lanka
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB The presence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PACs) in the environment and their associated hazards is a major global health concern; however, data on these compounds are scarce in developing nations. In the present study, the existence of 39 non-antimicrobial PACs and six of their metabolites in wastewater from hospitals and adjacent surface waters in Sri Lanka was investigated from 2016 to 2018. The highest amounts of the measured chemicals, including the highest concentrations of atorvastatin (14,620 ng/L) and two metabolites, mefenamic acid (12,120 ng/L) and o-desmethyl tramadol (8700 ng/L), were detected in wastewater from the largest facility. Mefenamic acid, gemfibrozil, losartan, cetirizine, carbamazepine, and phenytoin were detected in all the samples. The removal rates in wastewater treatment were 100% for zolpidem, norsertaline, quetiapine, chlorpromazine, and alprazolam. There was substantial variation in removal rates of PACs among facilities, and the overall data suggest that treatment processes in facilities were ineffective and that some PAC concentrations in the effluents were increased. The estimated risk quotients revealed that 14 PACs detected in water samples could pose low to high ecological risk to various aquatic organisms. Compounds such as ibuprofen, tramadol, and chlorpromazine detected in untreated and treated wastewater at these facilities pose a high risk to several aquatic organisms. Our study provides novel monitoring data for non-antimicrobial PAC abundance and the associated potential ecological risk related to hospitals and urban surface waters in Sri Lanka and further offers valuable information on pre-COVID-19 era PAC distribution in the country.

TI An integrated modelling approach to derive the grey water footprint of
   veterinary antibiotics
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Water pollution by veterinary antibiotics (VAs) resulting from livestock production is associated with severe environmental and human health risks. While upward trends in global animal product consumption signal that these risks might exacerbate toward the future, VA related water pollution is currently insufficiently understood. To increase this understanding, the present research assesses processes influencing VA pollution from VA administration to their discharge into freshwater bodies, using an integrated modelling approach (IMA). For the VAs amoxicillin, doxycycline, oxytetracycline, sulfamethazine, and tetracycline we estimate loads administered to livestock, excretion, degradation during manure storage, fate in soil and transport to surface water. Fate and transport are modelled using the VA transport model (VANTOM), which is fed with estimates from the PanEuropean Soil Erosion Risk Assessment (PESERA). The grey water footprint (GWF) is used to indicate the severity of water pollution in volumetric terms by combining VA loads and predicted no effect concentrations. We apply our approach to the German-Dutch Vecht river catchment, which is characterized by high livestock densities. Results show a VA mass load decrease larger than 99% for all substances under investigation, from their administration to surface water emission. Due to metabolization in the body, degradation during manure storage and degradation in soil, VA loads are reduced by 45%, 80% and 90% on average, respectively. While amoxicillin and sulfamethazine dissipate quickly after field application, significant fractions of doxycycline, oxytetracycline and tetracycline accumulate in the soil. The overall Vecht catchment's GWF is estimated at 250,000 m(3) yr(-1), resulting from doxycycline (81% and 19% contribution from the German and Dutch catchment part respectively). Uncertainty ranges of several orders of magnitude, as well as several remaining limitations to the presented IMA, underscore the importance to further develop and refine the approach.

TI Trade-off between vegetation type, soil erosion control and surface
   water in global semi-arid regions: A meta-analysis
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB Soil erosion control and water resource protection can closely interact during restoration of terrestrial ecosystems. In semi-arid ecosystems, an urgent issue is how vegetation restoration can achieve the goal of soil erosion mitigation and water conservation, which in turn, feeds back to ecosystem functioning.
   We reviewed 78 articles from 22 countries in semi-arid areas to evaluate the effects of vegetation type (i.e. forest, grassland and scrubland) on runoff and sediment yields across different environmental conditions (i.e. vegetation coverage, rainfall intensity, slope gradient and soil texture).
   Our meta-analysis shows that runoff and sediment reduction both increased as the vegetation coverage increased, and tended to be stable when vegetation coverage exceeded 60%. Vegetation provided a greater benefit for sediment reduction than for runoff control under intense rainfall. Grasslands were generally more effective in reducing sediment than other vegetation types. Forests, grasslands and scrublands were most efficient in soil erosion control on 20 degrees-30 degrees, 0 degrees-25 degrees and 10 degrees-25 degrees slopes respectively. Grasslands and scrublands generally performed better with respect to soil erosion control on moderately coarse soils, whereas forests were most effective on medium-textured and moderately fine soils.
   Synthesis and applications. Effective restoration and soil erosion control in semi-arid ecosystems strongly depends on the selection of vegetation type. Our study further indicates that, for land managers, it is critical to consider local slope, and soil texture, and maintain appropriate vegetation coverage to achieve ecosystem sustainability. Grasslands might be particularly suitable to optimize the trade-off between soil erosion control and surface water resource in semi-arid regions.

TI Incorporating infiltration in the two-dimensional ANUGA model for
   surface irrigation simulation
SO IRRIGATION SCIENCE
AB Improving irrigation efficiency on farms is crucial in securing a sustainable future for irrigators as well as the environment, especially in water scarce regions such as Australia. More efficient irrigation designs are increasingly being investigated using irrigation simulation models but there is a dearth of readily available two-dimensional (2D) models for investigating surface water flow within irrigation bays. This paper adapted the 2D ANUGA open source model to simulate border and basin irrigation by incorporating an infiltration algorithm based on the modified Kostiakov equation. The algorithm was successfully incorporated in ANUGA and the adapted model, ANUGA_MK, was tested using eight border and two basin irrigation events. ANUGA_MK performance was benchmarked against the one-dimensional (1D) SISCO irrigation model for border irrigation events, against the 2D B2D basin irrigation model for basin irrigation events and against observed data. ANUGA_MK adequately simulated surface water advance and depth. SISCO's total infiltration was comparable to that of ANUGA_MK, but its spatio-temporal dynamics differed due to differences in representation of microtopography. For example, the 1D SISCO model did not account for surface depression water storage remaining long after cessation of runoff. Performance of ANUGA_MK was similar to that of B2D in simulating basin irrigation. ANUGA can represent surface water flow on complex surfaces with diverse boundary conditions, and with an appropriate infiltration algorithm, has been adapted as a surface irrigation model that can be used to investigate bay surfaces engineered to improve surface drainage.

TI Using sodium percarbonate to suppress vertically distributed filamentous
   cyanobacteria while maintaining the stability of microeukaryotic
   communities in drinking water reservoirs
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB The increasing frequency and intensity of blooms of toxin- and taste & odour-producing filamentous cyanobacteria in water sources is a growing global issue. Compared to the common spherical Microcystis genus, the removal of filamentous cyanobacteria is more difficult in drinking water treatment plants; hence, abatement and control of the occurrence and proliferation of harmful filamentous cyanobacteria within drinking water sources is important for water supply. In this study, the solid sodium percarbonate (SPC), Na2CO3 center dot 1.5H(2)O(2), was used as an algaecide to eliminate the cyanobacteria distributed throughout the water column in the surface and bottom layer of a reservoir serving as a drinking water source. Results showed that although the oxidation capacity of SPC was higher in the surface water due to the higher light intensity than in the bottom water, 3.0 mg/L SPC can still suppress the harmful cyanobacteria in the bottom water after 36 h because the carbonate ion generated by SPC decomposition can act as an activator of H2O2 to generate many reactive oxygen species - including superoxide radicals, carbonate radical anions, and hydroxyl radicals - even in the light-limited environment. The obtained inactivation rates for the main cyanobacteria in this reservoir followed the order: Pseudanabaena limnetica > Raphidiopsis curvata > Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. 3.0 mg/L SPC has a slight impact on microeukaryotic communities according to the 18S rRNA gene sequencing, while 6.0 mg/L SPC changed the composition of eukaryotic phytoplankton and zooplankton clearly. Eukaryotic co-occurrence networks showed that although the network of eukaryotic plankton in treated surface water was more compact and clustered, stability of microeukaryotes in the treated surface water was lower than for the treated bottom water, owing to the higher oxidation capacity of SPC in the surface water. The results above not only have important implications for full-scale control of harmful cyanobacteria in drinking water sources, especially filamentous cyanobacteria with vertical distributions, but also help to ensure the health and stability of the whole aquatic ecosystem.

TI Ecosystem-based management of coral reefs under climate change
SO ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Coral reefs provide food and livelihoods for hundreds of millions of people as well as harbour some of the highest regions of biodiversity in the ocean. However, overexploitation, land-use change and other local anthropogenic threats to coral reefs have left many degraded. Additionally, coral reefs are faced with the dual emerging threats of ocean warming and acidification due to rising CO2 emissions, with dire predictions that they will not survive the century. This review evaluates the impacts of climate change on coral reef organisms, communities and ecosystems, focusing on the interactions between climate change factors and local anthropogenic stressors. It then explores the shortcomings of existing management and the move towards ecosystem-based management and resilience thinking, before highlighting the need for climate change-ready marine protected areas (MPAs), reduction in local anthropogenic stressors, novel approaches such as human-assisted evolution and the importance of sustainable socialecological systems. It concludes that designation of climate change-ready MPAs, integrated with other management strategies involving stakeholders and participation at multiple scales such as marine spatial planning, will be required to maximise coral reef resilience under climate change. However, efforts to reduce carbon emissions are critical if the long-term efficacy of local management actions is to be maintained and coral reefs are to survive.

TI Occurrence, potential sources and ecological risk estimation of
   microplastic towards coastal and estuarine zones in Malaysia
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB Extensive global plastic production has led to microplastic (MP) pollution of marine ecosystems. This study analysed the abundance of MPs in the surface water of tropical coastal and estuarine zones in Malaysia affected by rapid urbanisation and intense human activity. It also estimated the risk posed by MPs to the marine environment. Mean MP abundance ranged from 2.10 to 6.80 particles/L. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopic analysis found that the MP polymers were dominated by cellophane (54%), followed by polyester (33%) and polyethylene (2%). The risk posed by MPs was estimated with the risk quotient (RQ) method which found no potential ecological risk to both coastal and estuarine areas (RQ < 1). This study will serve as a baseline for future monitoring of MP pollution of marine water to assess the impact of heavily urbanised coastal and estuarine zones.

TI Mitigation of eutrophication caused by wastewater discharge: A
   simulation-based approach
SO AMBIO
AB Mitigation of eutrophication, intensified by excessive nutrient load discharge in wastewaters regulated by restrictive legal requirements, remains one of today's most important global problems. Despite implementation of the Water Framework Directive, the Urban Wastewater Directive and the HELCOM recommendations, the actual condition of surface water is still not satisfactory. In response to the above, the study presents an alternative approach for surface water protection against eutrophication based on the selection of appropriate nutrient removal technologies. An activated sludge model simulation was used to enable the identification of environmentally justified nutrient removal systems with lowest eutrophication potential of treated wastewater conditioned by bioavailable nutrient forms content. Based on the outcome of the study, the 3-stage Bardenpho system was identified as the most efficient for bioavailable phosphorus removal, while the Johannesburg system proved to have the highest efficiency for bioavailable nitrogen removal. The proposed eutrophication mitigation approach underlines the need for a reconsideration of current legal regulations which ignore nutrient bioavailability and key eutrophication limiting factors.

TI Occurrence and risk assessment of organic micropollutants in freshwater
   systems within the Lake Victoria South Basin, Kenya
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The unintended release of chemicals to the environment has led to global concern on water quality prompting widespread research on the occurrence of these compounds in water. While increasing information on organic micropollutants (OMPs) in European water resources is available, there is still limited information on the occurrence of OMPs in African water systems. In this study, a multi-residue analysis covering 428 chemicals using liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) was performed on water samples collected from 48 surface water sites within the Lake Victoria South Basin, Kenya. A total of 75 compounds including pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides, and industrial chemicals were detected and an additional three compounds (nevirapine, lamivudine and adenosine) were identified through suspect screening. Four compounds including diphenhydramine, simazi ne, triethylphosphate and acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (A-SMX) were detected in >80% of the sites showing their ubiquitous nature in the study area. Individual compound concentrations were detected up to 24 mu g L-1. Concentrations above 1 mu g L-1 were also reported for triethylcitrate, N-ethyl-o- toluenesulfonamide, hexazinone, nevirapine, adenosine and carbendazim. While crustaceans were potentially the taxon at risk for acute toxicity (toxic unit (TU) up to 2) with diazinon driving this risk, lower but substantial acute risk (TU 0.5) was observed for algae. Chronic risks were observed in 11 sites for algae (TU > 0.02) and in 5 sites for fish (TU > 0.01). A total of 16 compounds were prioritized based on frequency and extent of the exceedance of thresholds for acute and chronic risks to algae, crustaceans and fish and another 7 compounds prioritized by applying lowest Predicted No-Effect Concentrations (PNEC). Based on these indicators, this study provides candidate priority compounds for monitoring, assessment and abatement in western Kenya. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Rising environmental temperatures and polluted surface waters: the
   prelude to the rise of mycoses in South Africa
SO WATER SA
AB South Africa's rivers are frequently used by communities lacking proper sanitation infrastructure for domestic purposes; however, these surface waters may pose a health risk to immunocompromised individuals due to the presence of opportunistic pathogenic fungi in the polluted water. Although only a few studies have focused on the presence of clinically relevant fungal species in South African rivers, many known opportunistic pathogenic species were found to be predominant in these waters. Furthermore, strong evidence exists that increased numbers of clinically relevant species may be observed in future due to fungi acquiring thermotolerance in response to the global increase in temperature. Thermotolerance is a major factor contributing to pathogenesis in fungi, due to the generally low tolerance of most fungi toward mammalian body temperatures. It is therefore contended that combinatorial effects of water pollution and rising environmental temperatures could lead to an increase in the incidence of mycoses in South Africa.This is especially concerning since a relatively large population of immunocompromised individuals, represented mostly by HIV-infected people, resides in the country.

TI Evolution Characteristics of Rainfall and Runoff in the Upper Reaches of
   Zhang River Basin
SO WATER
AB It is of great significance to study and analyze the surface water resources and their change trend in the groundwater overexploitation area of the North China Plain, which is of great significance to solve the shortage of water resources in the groundwater overexploitation area of the North China Plain, promote the exploitation of groundwater, and realize the sustainable development of water resources. This paper takes Minyou Irrigation District of Handan City, a typical overexploitation area in the North China Plain, as an example. Based on the measured rainfall and runoff data from 1957 to 2020, the Mann-Kendall trend test, cumulative anomaly method, double cumulative curve method, and Morlet wavelet transform were used to analyze and predict the trend of water resources in the irrigation area and the individual contribution of climate change and human activities to runoff change. The results show that the annual rainfall and annual runoff in the irrigation area have a significant downward trend and significant cyclical changes throughout the study period. In 1977, the annual runoff showed a sudden change, and the average contribution rates of climate change and human activities to its change were 40.55% and 59.46%, respectively. In the future (2020-2035), runoff will remain stable and rainfall will show an increasing trend. The research results can provide scientific reference for the development, utilization, and rational allocation of surface water resources in the groundwater overexploitation area of the North China Plain.

TI Human exposure to antibiotic resistant-Escherichia coli through
   irrigated lettuce
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) have been found on fresh fruit and vegetables globally. These types of ARB infections are spreading rapidly and are a major human health threat. A quantitative human exposure assessment model was created using scenario analysis to investigate the potential human exposure to antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli (AR-E. coli) through the consumption of lettuce irrigated with surface water. Scientific literature and site specific data were collected to model each process from farm to fork to calculate the concentration of AR-E. coli on the lettuce at the point of human consumption. The processes examined were the adhesion, colonisation and viability of bacteria on the lettuce; the effect of different post-harvest cleaning processes; the effect of consuming the lettuce before, on or after the expiry date; and the effect of the consumer washing the lettuce. The results show the mean human exposure levels ranged between 1.00 x 10(-2) and 1.35 x 10(6) colony forming units (CFU) of AR-E. coli per 100 g of surface water irrigated lettuce for the different scenarios investigated. The mean probability of illness from consuming 100 g of lettuce contaminated with potential pathogenic antibiotic-sensitive E. coli was between 1.46 x 10(-9) to 1.88 x 10(-2). A back calculation revealed that in order for the EC No 1441/2007 regulation to be exceeded (>= 1000 CFU/g of E. coli on lettuce at the manufacturing stage), the mean contamination levels required in the irrigation water would need to be 2.7, 3.1 or 4.8 log CFU/ml using the post-harvest treatments of washing with water, rapid cooling with water and washing with a chlorine solution respectively. The information generated from this model could help to set guidelines for producers on maximum permissible AR-E. coli contamination levels in irrigation water and provides recommendations on the best post-harvest treatment to use.

TI Computer-assisted Development of ad hoc Methodology for Monitoring of
   Inorganic Cations in Surface Water Using Gradient Elution Ion
   Chromatography
SO CROATICA CHEMICA ACTA
AB This work focuses on development of ad hoc methodology for monitoring of sodium, ammoniurn, potassium, magnesium and calcium ions in rivers Ilova and Kutinica (southeastern part of Croatia) since often their composition significantly differs from the average (concentration of components and/or matrix). Therefore fast and reliable method development has to be performed in order to meet criteria of the monitoring methodology performance characteristic. Computer assisted routine for prediction of chromatographic signal, based on a transfer of isocratic elution information into a gradient elution environment, was used in combination with several in-house developed optimization criteria. It is shown that algorithm used for prediction of ion-chromatographic signal offers sufficient information (in comparison to actual measured chromatographic signal) to be applied in global optimization process. Calculated optimal gradient incorporates linearly decreasing, increasing and isocratic part of the eluent concentration time-profile, utilizing full potential of the gradient separation. Developed method was validated proving that it meets criteria for river Ilova and Kutinica monitoring purposes. Moreover, this results show that used computer assisted optimization routine can be successfully applied for fast and reliable ad hoc method development in ion chromatography. (doi: 10.5562/cca1736)

TI Compounding effects of human activities and climatic changes on surface
   water availability in Iran
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB By combining long-term ground-based data on water withdrawal with climate model projections, this study quantifies the compounding effects of human activities and climate change on surface water availability in Iran over the twenty-first century. Our findings show that increasing water withdrawal in Iran, due to population growth and increased agricultural activities, has been the main source of historical water stress. Increased levels of water stress across Iran are expected to continue or even worsen over the next decades due to projected variability and change in precipitation combined with heightened water withdrawals due to increasing population and socio-economic activities. The greatest rate of decreased water storage is expected in the Urmia Basin, northwest of Iran, (varying from -8.3mm/year in 2010-2039 to -61.6mm/year in 2070-2099 compared with an observed rate of 4mm/year in 1976-2005). Human activities, however, strongly dominate the effects of precipitation variability and change. Major shifts toward sustainable land and water management are needed to reduce the impacts of water scarcity in the future, particularly in Iran's heavily stressed basins like Urmia Basin, which feeds the shrinking Lake Urmia.

TI Fuel from within: Can suspended phosphorus maintain algal blooms in Lake
   Dianchi
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Extensive algal bloom in the surface water is a pressing issue in Lake Dianchi that causes lake restoration to be difficult owing to complex and variable phosphorus (P) sources in the water column. P released from algae, suspended particles (SS), and sediment can provide sustainable P sources for algal blooms. However, little is known regarding the dynamic of P speciation in these substances from different sources. In this study, solution P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (P-31 NMR) and chemical sequential extraction were employed to identify P speciation in algae, SS, and sediment during different periods. Results showed that dissolved inorganic P (P-i) directly accumulated in algae in the form of orthophosphate (ortho-P) and pyrophosphate (pyro-P). Algae preferentially utilized P-i, followed by organic P (P-o) in the water column when the Pi was insufficient during growth and reproduction. The P-31 NMR spectra demonstrated that ortho-P, orthophosphate monoesters (mono -P), orthophosphate diesters (diester-P), and pyro-P dominated the P compounds across the samples tested. Increasing remineralization of SS mono-P driven by intense alkaline phosphatase activities was caused by increasing P needs of algae and pressure of P supply in the water column. The higher ratios of diester-P to mono-P in sediment (mean 0.55) than those in algae (mean 0.07) and SS (mean 0.11 in surface water, 0.14 in bottom water) suggested that the degradation and regeneration occurred within these P compounds during or after sedimentation. Pi content in algae during growth and reproduction was controlled by its P absorption and utilization strategies. Results of this study provide insights into the dynamic cycling of P in algae, SS, and sediment, explaining the reason for algal blooms in the surface water with low concentrations of dissolved P.

TI Groundwater resources in Maknassy basin (central Tunisia): hydrological
   data analysis and water budgeting
SO GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL
AB The Maknassy basin in central Tunisia receives only a small amount of precipitation (207 mm/year), and hydrological system retain very small quantities of water due to the steep topography and surface water resource partially mobilized which is evacuated toward the basin outlet. However, the Maknassy plain support agriculture based on ground water irrigation with increasing water demand for the last decades. These developments have boosted agricultural productivity in the region. While these problems are mainly due to poor surface water management strategies in the region, the groundwater resources in this basin should be properly assessed and suitable measures taken for uniform surface water mobilization. As a first step in this direction, groundwater resources have been assessed. Regional specific yield (0.017) and groundwater recharge have been estimated on the basis of water table fluctuation method. During the hydrological year 2004-2005, groundwater recharge amounting to 116*10(6) m(3) in a year takes place in the region through infiltration of rainwater (44.5* 10(6) m(3) for phreatic aquifer and 71.5*10(6) m(3) for the deep one), and recharge due to the infiltration in the Leben watercourse bed (1.57* 10(6) m(3)). Recharge from deeper aquifer to the shallow one has been estimated at 0.01*10(6) m(3). The outflow consists of (1) groundwater draft by wells (4.5*10(6) m(3) from phreatic aquifer and 5.78* 10(6) m(3) from the deep one), (2) spring discharges (0.15*10(6) m(3) only from shallow aquifer), and (3) groundwater evapotranspiration (92.52* 10(6) m(3)). Assuming that at least 40% (102.61*10(6) m(3)) of the total precipitation water (256.645* 10(6) m(3)) makes the runoff water, this important resource can be mobilized in order to increase groundwater recharge. Subject to an arid climate, such region requires an integrated water resource management. It permits to keep aquiferous system equilibrium and participate to the sustainable development which integrates natural resource management.

TI Groundwater mining of bedrock aquifers in the Denver Basin - past,
   present, and future
SO ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY
AB The Denver Basin bedrock aquifer system is an important source of water for municipal and agricultural uses in the Denver and Colorado Springs metropolitan areas. The Denver area is one of the fastest growing areas in the United States with a population of 1.2 million in 1960 that has increased to over 2.4 million by 2000. This rapid population growth has produced a corresponding increase in demand for potable water. Historically, the Denver area has relied on surface water, however, in the past 10 years new housing and recreation developments have begun to rely on groundwater from the bedrock aquifers as the surface water is fully appropriated and in short supply. The Denver Basin bedrock aquifer system consists of Tertiary and Cretaceous age sedimentary rocks known as the Dawson, Denver, Arapahoe and Laramie-Fox Hills Aquifers. The number of bedrock wells has increased from 12,000 in 1985 to 33,700 in 2001 and the withdrawal of groundwater has caused water level declines of 76 m. Water level declines for the past 10 years have ranged from 3 to 12 m per year. The groundwater supplies were once thought to last 100 years but there is concern that the groundwater supplies may be essentially depleted in 10 to 15 years in areas on the west side of the basin. Extensive development of the aquifer system has occurred in the last 25 years especially near the center of the basin in Douglas and El Paso Counties where rapid urban growth continues and surface water is lacking. Groundwater is being mined from the aquifer system because the discharge by wells exceeds the rate of recharge. Concern is mounting that increased groundwater withdrawal will cause water level declines, increased costs to withdraw groundwater, reduced well yield, and reduced groundwater storage. As the long-term sustainability of the groundwater resource is in doubt, water managers believe that the life of the Denver Basin aquifers can be extended with artificial recharge, water reuse, restrictions on lawn watering, well permit restrictions and conservation measures.

TI A review on tetracycline removal from aqueous systems by advanced
   treatment techniques
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Tetracycline (TC), a frequently used drug for human and veterinary therapeutics, is among the most common antibiotic residues found in nature. Lack of advanced treatment techniques in the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to remove residual TC from domestic and hospital wastewater poses a serious environmental risk. It is important to have an insight into the different advanced treatment techniques for efficient removal of TC from the surface water and in the WWTPs. The aim of this review is to discuss the nature and occurrence of TC in surface water and to present an overview of the various advanced treatment techniques for TC removal. The advanced treatment techniques include advanced oxidation processes (photolysis, ozonation, and catalytic/UV light-based degradation), membrane filtration, reverse osmosis, and adsorption techniques. Adsorption and integrated oxidation treatment techniques are the most widely studied methods, and they are widely accepted because of less cost, reusability, and toxic-free nature. Further, the uses of various types of catalysts for photodegradation and various sorbents for adsorption of TC are also presented. Finally, the importance of green nanocomposite for environmental sustainability in TC removal is emphasized.

TI Aquifer Drawdown and Recovery in the Northeast Groundwater Management
   Area, Wisconsin, USA: A Century of Groundwater Use
SO GEOSCIENCES
AB The Northeast Groundwater Management Area of Wisconsin, USA contains two major cones of depression in a confined sandstone aquifer. Each cone is centered near cities that have used groundwater for over 100 years. Near one of these cities (Green Bay), episodic changes in the development of groundwater and surface water resources during this period have resulted in major changes to the potentiometric surface. On two occasions, roughly 50 years apart, reductions in groundwater withdrawals have resulted from the construction of pipelines drawing surface water from Lake Michigan. In each case, rapid recovery of the potentiometric surface by as much as 70 m has occurred in the northern of the two pumping cones. The most recent switch occurred during 2006 and 2007 when eight communities stopped pumping groundwater, reducing daily withdrawals by approximately 46.37 million liters. The rate of water level recovery has diminished in some areas, with a return to a flowing artesian state for some municipal and residential wells. Although the northern portion of the groundwater management area has returned to a sustainable condition in the confined aquifer, the portion with the southern cone of depression remains in a state of prolonged drawdown.

TI Evaluating Antarctic marine protected area scenarios using a dynamic
   food web model
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB Marine protected areas, especially when they are or include no-take zones, can support conservation objectives by creating an area where marine organisms are protected from human disturbances, particularly fishing. The coast of the Antarctic continent is the only habitat of the iconic Adelie penguin, whose main diet is Antarctic krill. Current threats to Adelie Penguins, other Antarctic krill predators and Antarctic krill itself include sea-ice loss as a result of climate change and krill fishing. We use a spatially and temporally dynamic food web model of the region surrounding the Western Antarctic Peninsula to evaluate the potential impacts of various marine protected area scenarios in the context of climate change. We examine the effects of sustained sea-ice loss on krill and seven monitored krill predators. We evaluate four marine protected area scenarios given two scenarios that describe future changes in sea ice and three scenarios that describe future changes in krill fishing effort. Our results indicate that establishing no-take zones where krill might aggregate in the future and where some krill predators forage could positively affect biomass accumulation of krill and the predators. No-take zones may be particularly important for enhancing the resilience of species that have recently experienced population decline and ensuring positive outcomes from establishing a marine protected area in the region. Our simulations suggest that establishing protected areas in the right locations can play an important role in mitigating the negative effects of climate change on iconic species that many people want to conserve.

TI A review on green technologies for the rejuvenation of polluted surface
   water bodies: Field-scale feasibility, challenges, and future
   perspectives
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB The global paucity of water resources and the degradation of water quality have necessitated a need for the restoration of water bodies for the last two decades. Due to increasingly stringent requirements in quality, reliability, economics and sustainability, treatment of polluted water employing traditional technologies has become a formidable challenge many a time in meeting the desired goals. Green technologies are identified as a sustainable method that can boost social and economic growth, conserve natural resources and reduce detrimental impacts on the environment and social wellbeing. However, less effort has been made to render a comprehensive overview from the perspective of the real-world application of these technologies and their underlying mechanisms. This review attempts to provide a critical insight into the frugal and eco-friendly technologies under three groups viz. microbial technologies, bio preparations and integrated eco-technologies by considering various factors such as optimum operating conditions, underlying mechanisms, efficiency, techno-economic viability, and potential challenges. Among these, integrated ecotechnologies have shown the best performance for the removal of a wide range of pollutants in the real-world scenario. These are superior in ensuring the consistency and durability of the efficacy of the systems. The present review is expected to aid in the selection of appropriate technologies for surface water rejuvenation under varying conditions and would lead to an addition in the existing knowledge base on surface water remediation methods enabling further research in this domain.

TI Estimating global marine surface microplastic abundance: systematic
   literature review
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Toxicity and persistence of microplastics (MP) in the marine environment has a potential to disturb the ecological balance of the planet. To evaluate the gravity of the situation, continuity in research of MP abundance is required. In this work for the first time a systematic literature review was conducted to build abundance datasets of MP at marine surface waters that were used to estimate average MP abundance and produce maps. Due to non-Gaussian distribution of the data, non-parametric statistics were used. The results show that an estimated average of approximately 6300 MP km-2 MP float at the surface of the oceans. Additionally, observations of drawbacks in MP research that hamper inter research comparability were made and these mainly include heterogeneity of methods and poor reporting practice. Basic guidelines to improve future research comparability were devised. Results provided here can be beneficial to research that requires a reliable and comparable MP abundance datasets sourced in a transparent and rigorous manner. These datasets are made available to the readers.

SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been used in consumer and military products since the 1950s but are increasingly scrutinized worldwide because of inherent chemical properties, environmental contamination, and risks to public health and the environment. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) identified 24 PFASs of interest for further study and possible regulation. We examined 371 peerreviewed studies published since 2001 to understand the occurrence and distribution of 24 priority PFASs in global surface waters and groundwater. We identified 77,541 and 16,246 data points for surface waters and groundwater, respectively, with total PFAS concentrations ranging from low pg/L to low mg/L levels. Most data were from Asia, Europe, and North America with some reports from Oceania. PFAS information from other geographic regions is lacking. PFASs levels are consistently higher in rivers and streams followed by lakes and reservoirs and then coastal and marine systems. When sufficient data were available, probabilistic environmental hazard assessments (PEHAs) were performed from environmental exposure distributions (EEDs) to identify potential exceedances of available guideline values for each compound by matrix, region, and aquatic system. Specifically, exceedances of USEPA drinking water lifetime health advisory levels were up to 74% for PFOS in groundwater from Oceania and 69% for PFOA in North American groundwater. Our findings support selection of environmentally relevant experimental treatment levels for future toxicology, ecotoxicology and bioaccumulation studies, and potable source water exposure investigations, while highlighting PFASs and major geographic locations requiring additional study and inclusion in global monitoring and surveillance campaigns.

TI Environmental risk assessment of the anthelmintic albendazole in Eastern
   Africa, based on a systematic review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB This study performs an environmental risk assessment (ERA) of the anthelmintic medicine albendazole (ABZ) in the eastern African region. A systematic literature search strategy was applied to obtain quantitative information on the physicochemical characteristics, the metabolization-fate, the ecotoxicity and the environmental occurrence in different countries worldwide serving as model regions. In addition, in silico tools were employed to obtain data on physicochemical characteristics and toxic hazards of ABZ and its metabolites. Moreover, ERA models were used to predict environmental concentrations in different compartments and compare them with the measured environmental concentrations. Finally, the environmental risk of ABZ in the eastern Africa was estimated by calculating the risk quotient (RQ), and its uncertainty estimated by Monte Carlo simulation. The predicted environmental concentrations of ABZ in surface water in the model region based on consumption (1.6-267 ng/L) were within the range of values obtained from the measured environmental concentrations of the same region (0.05-101,000 ng/L). Using these models with adapted input variables for eastern Africa, the predicted surface water concentration in that region was 19,600 +/- 150 ng/L (95% CI). The calculated soil concentrations of ABZ in the model regions and the eastern Africa were found to be 0.057 +/- 0.0 mu g/kg and 0.022 +/- 0.0 mu g/kg, respectively. The environmental risk expressed as risk quotient of ABZ in eastern Africa estimated for the aquatic compartment (146 +/- 1) indicated a significant environmental risk calling on appropriate actions from the competent authorities to reduce this risk in this region.

TI Water Resources Assessment and Regional Virtual Water Potential in the
   Turpan Basin, China
SO WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB Located in the centre of the Eurasian Continent, the Turpan Basin, as the second deepest lowland in the world, is extremely short of water resources. Aimed at this key scientific issue, this paper based on years of meteorological and hydrological observation data, carried out a scientific calculation and evaluation of surface and groundwater resources in the Turpan Basin, and then, with the help of modified Penman formula, calculated the virtual water potential in the basin in 2004. The results show that the average total usable surface water resources per year in the last decade were about 6.673x10(8) m(3), while adduction volume of surface water in 2003 was about 4.94x10(8) m(3), which means that most of the region has reached or approached the limit of water resources and, as a result serious crises and constraints on the development of the basin were thus caused. The exploitation content of groundwater in the Turpan Basin in 2003 was about 6.12x10(8) m(3), which has basically reached its upper limit, and the ground water level has fallen about 10 similar to 40 m in the Turpan Basin in recent years. The daily reference crop water requirement in the Turpan Basin in 2004 was about 1,053.39 mm, and the total virtual water potential contained in six main crops was about 5.25 x10(8) m(3) in 2004. All these showed that research works on scientific assessment of water resources and regional virtual water strategy have great significance for the best social, ecological, economic benefits and regional sustainable development of the Turpan Basin.

TI Occurrence of Hepatitis A Virus in Water Matrices: A Systematic Review
   and Meta-Analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Hepatitis A is a common form of viral hepatitis. It is usually transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food and water. This systematic review was carried out to summarise the overall prevalence of Hepatitis A virus (HAV) in different water matrices: untreated and treated wastewater, surface water, groundwater, drinking water, and others (e.g., irrigation water and floodwater). The literature search was performed in four databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Global Index Medicus, and Excerpta Medica Database. Heterogeneity (I-2) was assessed using the chi(2) test on the Cochran Q statistic and H parameters. A total of 200 prevalence data from 144 articles were included in this meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of HAV in water matrices was 16.7% (95% CI: 13.4-20.3). The prevalence for individual matrix was as follows: 31.4% (95% CI: 23.0-40.4) untreated wastewater, 18.0% (95% CI: 9.5-28.2) treated wastewater, 15.0% (95% CI: 10.1-20.5) surface water, 2.3% (95% CI: 0.1-6.0) in groundwater, 0.3% (95% CI: 0.0-1.7) in drinking water, and 8.5% (95% CI: 3.1-15.6) in other matrices. The prevalence was higher in low-income economies (29.0%). Africa and Eastern Mediterranean were the regions with higher HAV prevalence values. This study showed a high heterogeneity (I-2 > 75%) with a significant publication bias (p value Egger test < 0.001). The results of this review suggest that water matrices could be an important route of HAV transmission even in industrialized countries, despite the lower prevalence compared to less industrialized countries, and the availability of advanced water management systems. More effective water/wastewater treatment strategies are needed in developing countries to limit the environmental circulation of HAV.

TI Assessment of climate change effects in Aegean river basins: the case of
   Gediz and Buyuk Menderes Basins
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) discloses that the global climate system is undoubtedly warming. Observations have shown that many natural systems, including hydrologic systems and water resources, are being affected by regional climate changes, particularly temperature increases. Eventually, these effects will have to be considered in water resources planning and management. Accordingly, need is indicated to evaluate the impact of expected climate change on hydrology and water resources at regional and local levels. The presented paper summarizes the results of the sub-project studies under the United Nations Development Program-Global Environment Facility (UNDP-GEF) Project. The studies cover the generation of climate change scenarios, modeling of basin hydrology, and testing the sensitivity of runoff to changes in precipitation and temperature. Simulation results of the water budget model have shown that nearly 20% of the surface waters in the studied basins will be reduced by the year of 2030. By the years 2050 and 2100, this percentage will increase up to 35% and more than 50%, respectively. The decreasing surface water potential of the basins will cause serious water stress problems among water users, mainly being agricultural, domestic and industrial water users.

TI Assessments on surface water resources and their vulnerability and
   adaptability in China
SO ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH
AB A clear understanding of the changes of water resources under the background of environmental changes is of great significance for scientific management and utilization of water resources in China. This study systematically analyzed the spatial-temporal variations of surface water resources in China since 2000. Water vulnerability in current (2010s) and its trends from 2000 to late-2010s in different regions of China were also summarized. In addition, the correspondingly adaptive measures to counter regional risks to water resources were proposed. We concluded that the runoff of major rivers had been decreasing in eastern China and increasing in western China during 2000-2018. In the arid area of Northwest China, the alpine runoff has shown an overall upward trend since the late-1990s/early-2000s, with a 10%-25% increase caused by the increase of glacial meltwater and precipitation. While the runoff of each hydrological station in the 2000s-2010s was 34.7% lower than that in the 1950s-2010s on average. The increases in precipitation and glacial meltwater with global warming caused a rapid expansion of lakes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Xinjiang, thus leading to an increase in total area and water quantity of lakes in China from 1995 to 2015. The mean contribution rates of climate change and human activity to runoff change in river basins of China were 53.5% and 46.5%, respectively, during the period of 2000-2010s. The driving factor of runoff change in many river basins has gradually changed from climate change (1950s-2000) to human activity (2000-2018). During 2000-2018, the contributions of human activities to runoff change were 50%-80% in major rivers of eastern China. The vulnerability in most areas of Northwest China and North China is generally high, with the vulnerability index greater than 0.6. Comparatively, in Northeast, East, South, and Central China, it is lower or not vulnerable. In Southwest China, the vulnerability varies greatly with Yunnan and Sichuan relatively low while Chongqing and Guizhou relatively high. The precipitation increase, the application of water-saving technology, the establishment of flood control and drought relief engineering facilities, and the introduction of relevant policies and measures have helped to gradually reduce the vulnerability of water resources in most areas of North and Northwest China (except Xinjiang) from 2000 to 2010s. Water vulnerability has been increasing in southern China, caused by climate change and the development of industry and agriculture, which increases water resource exposure since 2000. Based on the typical risk factors and vulnerability characteristics of water resources in different regions, this study proposed some targeted adaptive measures correspondingly so as to scientifically deal with the problems of surface water resources in China.

TI A novel approach to baseline water quality assessment at local and
   catchment scale: a case study from Berambadi, India
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB Optimal design and maintenance are necessary for the sustainability of wastewater treatment systems. In this study, we present the outcome of a novel approach to baseline assessment conducted prior to the design and deployment of a decentralized wastewater treatment system at a school in rural India. The baseline water quality monitoring protocol was deployed to assess (a) the quality and quantity of wastewater (greywater and blackwater) flows from the school and (b) the status of surface water and groundwater quality in the catchment. Hourly greywater flows and water quality trends were monitored across four seasons at the school. Average freshwater consumption at the school was 518 +/- 322 L/day for hand washing and 287 +/- 97 L/day for cooking meals. Greywater generation showed high hourly variations in COD levels. Greywater generated from hand wash and kitchen sources contributed to 110 g/day and 96 g/day of BOD5 respectively and 214 g/day and 141 g/day of COD respectively. Based on additional data from a self-reporting sanitation survey, the organic contaminant load generated from the toilet was estimated to be 1.5 +/- 0.1 kg COD/day. At the catchment scale, both groundwater and surface water quality were monitored seasonally to assess the impact of raw sewage and stormwater inputs. Compared with borewells, high nitrate-N levels (> 10 mg/L) were observed in the village hand pump samples throughout the year. Maximum nitrate-N (16 mg/L) and fecal coliforms (3.9 log MPN/100 mL) levels were observed in surface waters during monsoons, indicating the impact of sewage and surface runoff on water quality. The proposed approach is useful to estimate data on freshwater use and wastewater generation at the school and hence to make the case for, and design of, a sustainable water management intervention.

TI Sustainable Surface Water Storage Development: Measuring Economic
   Benefits and Ecological and Social Impacts of Reservoir System
   Configurations
SO WATER
AB This paper illustrates an approach to measuring economic benefits and ecological and social impacts of various configurations of reservoir systems for basin-wide planning. It suggests indicators and examines their behavior under several reservoir arrangement scenarios using two river basins in Sri Lanka as examples. A river regulation index is modified to take into account the volume of flow captured by reservoirs and their placement and type. Indices of connectivity illustrate that the lowest river connectivity in a basin results from a single new reservoir placed on the main stem of a previously unregulated river between the two locations that command 50% and 75% of the basin area. The ratio of the total affected population to the total number of beneficiaries is shown to increase as the cumulative reservoir capacity in a river basin increases. An integrated index comparing the performance of different reservoir system configurations shows that while results differ from basin to basin, the cumulative effects of a large number of small reservoirs may be comparable to those with a few large reservoirs, especially at higher storage capacities.

TI PRODUCTIVITY ACROSS THE CRETACEOUS-TERTIARY BOUNDARY IN HIGH-LATITUDES
SO GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN
AB In low and middle latitudes, the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary is marked by a sudden and pronounced decrease in deltaC-13 values of near-surface-water carbonates and a reduction in the surface-to-bottom deltaC-13 gradient.  These isotopic data have been interpreted as evidence of a decline in surface-water productivity that was responsible for the extinction of many planktic foraminiferal species and other marine organisms at or near the K/T boundary.  We present planktic and benthic foraminiferal isotopic data from two almost biostratigraphically complete sections at Ocean Drilling Program Site 738 in the antarctic Indian Ocean and at Nye Klov in Denmark.  These data suggest that planktic carbonate deltaC-13 values in high latitudes may not have decreased dramatically at the K/T boundary; thus, surface-water productivity may not have been reduced as much as in low and middle latitudes.  Comparison of the records of Site 738 with those of ODP Sites 690 and 750 indicates a pronounced decline in deltaC-13 values of planktic and benthic foraminifera and fine-fraction/bulk carbonate approximately 200 000 yr after the K/T boundary.  This reflects a regional shift in the carbon isotopic composition of oceanic total dissolved carbon (TDC) and correlates with a similar change in benthic foraminiferal deltaC-13 values at mid- and low-latitude Deep Sea Drilling Project Sites 527 and 577.  This oceanographic event was followed by the ecosystem's global recovery approximately 500 000 yr after the K/T boundary.  These data suggest that the environmental effects of the K/T boundary may have been less severe in the high-latitude oceans than in tropical and subtropical regions.

TI An integrated study of the spatiotemporal character, pollution
   assessment, and migration mechanism of heavy metals in the groundwater
   of a subtropical mangrove wetland
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB Mangrove wetlands connecting the land and sea are critical and dynamic ecosystems which act as biogeochemical reactors that influence the concentrations and distributions of heavy metals in the groundwater and adjacent seawater. In this paper, a subtropical mangrove wetland in China was selected to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of groundwater heavy metals and the driving mechanism along an intertidal transect with distinct undulated topography and vegetation zonation. Along the transect, five groundwater observation wells (W1-5) were set to collect groundwater samples at three different sediment depths (0.5, 1.2, and 2.0 m) and the advective flux between groundwater and surface water were calculated during four seasonal sampling campaigns from 2019 to 2020. The results showed that the seaward W1-3 acted as the groundwater discharge area while the landward W4-5 served as the surface water recharge area. The results of single-factor contamination index showed that a potential pollution risk of Hg existed at the study sites. The distribution of other heavy metals in the mangrove groundwater exhibited a seasonal variability along the transect during the sampling campaigns. For example, the relative high concentrations of Fe, Pb, Cu, Cr, and Zn focused in the landward zones in the dry seasons (autumn and winter 2019), whereas they changed to the seaward zones in the wet seasons (summer and autumn 2020). Moreover, the intertidal aquifer can act as a sink to enrich heavy metals in winter 2019 and autumn 2020 but become a source to discharge heavy metals to the sea in summer 2020. The above migration patterns of heavy metals were ascribed to the multiple complex factors including the seawater-groundwater interactions, vegetation zonation, biogeochemical reactions, and anthropogenic activities. This study contributed to the better understanding of heavy metal behaviors in mangrove groundwater so as to improve the sustainable management of mangrove wetlands under the pressure of anthropogenic activities and climate change.

TI Is there a significant difference in microbiota between water and
   microplastic surfaces in winter? The possibility of spreading offshore
   into the ocean
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Environmental problems caused by microplastics (MPs) are attracting global attention. The ecological risks of bacteria attached to MPs have not been studied in detail under low temperature conditions. Here, MPs in surface water were sampled in winter from the Changjiang (or Yangtze) River Estuary. The physical and chemical characteristics of the MPs were identified, and the diversity and species composition of bacteria on the surface water MPs were analyzed. Phenotypic prediction analysis was used to analyze the potential risk of bacteria in the biofilm on the surfaces of MPs. The main chemical composition in the MPs in the surface water were PP (polypropylene), PE (polyethylene), PS (polystyrene) and other light weight MPs. Sampling sites played a decisive role in the bacterial species composition. The potential plastic-degrading bacterium Acinetobacter and the potential pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas showed significant differences across different sampling sites. Microbial communities on the surfaces of MPs in winter were not significantly different from planktonic bacteria in the water body. Phenotypic prediction results showed that bacteria on the surface of MPs had a marked capacity to form biofilms, but a low pathogenicity risk. Based on the results of bio-diversity analysis and phenotypic prediction, the potential ecological risk of bacteria in biofilms on MP surfaces is lower at low temperatures. In addition, the numerical simulation results show that the possibility of bacteria attached to MPs from the Changjiang River entering the Pacific Ocean in winter is small. MPs attached bacteria in the Changjiang estuary have low ecological risk to the estuary and the Pacific Ocean in winter.

TI Post-traumatic stress in people from the interior drylands of the Maule
   region, Chile in the context of climate change
SO GEOSPATIAL HEALTH
AB Progressive changes in local environmental scenarios, accelerated by global climate change, can negatively affect the mental health of people who inhabit these areas. The magnitude of these effects may vary depending on the socioeconomic conditions of people and the characteristics of the environment, so certain territories can be more vulnerable than others. In this context, the present study aimed to geographically analyse the levels of psychosocial impact and the types of disruptive responses related to the new territorial scenarios caused by climate change in the coastal drylands of the Maule region, Chile. For this purpose, 223 people from two communes (Curepto and Pencahue) were psychosocially evaluated for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) together with a survey of the prevailing sociodemographic and socioeconomic conditions in relation to the environmental variables of the territory. All information was georeferenced, stored within an ArcGIS Desktop geographic information system (GIS) and then investigated by application of contingency tables, ANOVA and local clustering analysis using SSP statistical software. The results indicated a high level of PTSD in the population, with significant dif-ferences related to age and education as well as employment con-ditions and income. The spatial results showed high PTSD values in the communal capital of Curepto in the central agricultural val-ley near the estuary of the local river, while the existence of coldspots was observed in the central valley of the Pencahue com-mune. It was concluded that proximity to population centres and surface water sources played the greatest role for the development of PTSD.

TI Influence of reservoir management on the source and transport of
   particulate organic carbon in surface waters of the lower Yellow River
SO JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
AB Purpose Large rivers play an important role in the global carbon cycle through the transportation of particulate organic carbon (POC) from the continent to the ocean. Human disturbance such as water-sediment regulation (WSR) significantly changes the downstream fluxes of sediment and POC. However, the sources and variations of POC affected by WSR in the lower Yellow River remain poorly understood.
   Methods The surface water samples were collected in the lower Yellow River, and the concentration and the median grain size (MGS) of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and the particulate organic carbon (POC) were measured. In addition, the C/N ratios and stable carbon isotopic composition (delta(13)Corg) of the POC in the surface waters of the lower Yellow River before and after the WSR of the Xiaolangdi reservoir were also analyzed to explore the spatio-temporal changes of POC transport.
   Results Both SPM and POC concentrations were significantly higher before WSR than after WSR and showed different deposit and scour features along the lower Yellow River, mainly due to the different water discharge and particulate contents. Correlation analysis shows that POC% and MGS were the main factors that influence the variation of POC before WSR, while SPM was the main factor after WSR. The C/N ratio in the surface water of the lower Yellow River before WSR was significantly higher than that after WSR, while d13Corg showed the opposite trend. Application of a two-end- member mixing model of d13Corg suggests that, on average, about 56.4% and 82.0% of the POC is derived from terrestrial soil and that approximately 43.6% and 18% of the POC is derived from C3 plant detritus before and after WSR, respectively.
   Conclusion Our research indicates that SPM and POC transport in the lower Yellow River was significantly affected by the WSR of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir. Therefore, the effect of WSR on the transport and environmental implication of POC should be considered in the management of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir in the future.

TI Summertime Chlorophyll a and Particulate Organic Carbon Standing Stocks
   in Surface Waters of the Fram Strait and the Arctic Ocean (1991-2015)
SO FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB Sea ice in the Arctic Ocean (AO) has been undergoing dramatic changes during the last two decades. In addition, the water temperature of the inflow of Atlantic water masses at the gateway Fram Strait has recently increased. Long-term data may help to evaluate the impact of these physical changes on the biological processes in surface waters. Over a 25-year period, and mostly in summer, water samples were collected at discrete depths within the uppermost 100 m of the Fram Strait and other regions of the AO to investigate chlorophyll a (Chl a) and particulate organic carbon (POC) standing stocks. Stations sampled from 1991 to 2015 were located in the Fram Strait, Barents Sea (BS), on the Eurasian shelf, and over the Nansen, Amundsen, and parts of the Amerasian basins (AB). Discrete Chl a and POC measurements obtained during 33 and 24 expeditions, respectively, were integrated over the upper 100 m of the water column to monitor spatial and interannual variations in distribution patterns of standing stocks. In general, the highest Chl a and POC standing stocks were observed in the eastern Fram Strait (EFS) and in the BS, while the lowest biomasses were observed in the heavily ice-covered regions of the central AO, mainly in the Amundsen and ABs. Whereas summertime Chl a stocks sharply decreased northward from the Fram Strait and Barents Sea toward high latitudes, the decline in POC standing stocks was less pronounced. Over the sampling period, summertime Chl a stocks slightly increased in the EFS but remained more or less constant in the central AO. In contrast to Chl a, standing stocks of POC eventually increased over the last 25 years in the central AO, possibly as an effect of increasing air temperatures, decreasing sea ice extent and thickness, and increasing light availability. Moreover, variations in riverine discharge and in sea ice export within the Transpolar Drift may have contributed to the enhanced POC stock in the central AO surface waters. Overall, the objective of the present study was to provide baseline datasets of Chl a and POC to better track the effects of environmental changes due to global warming on the Arctic pelagic system.

TI Cryptosporidium and Giardia in feral water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) in
   the South East Arnhem Land Indigenous Protected Area, Australia
SO PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB Global investigations have implicated water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) as a potential source of zoonotic Cryptosporidium and Giardia parasites which may pose a threat to human health. In Australia, buffalo are a feral pest that have colonised the floodplains, wetlands and woodlands of Indigenous owned and managed Arnhem Land, in tropical monsoonal Northern Australia. Indigenous people from the remote community Ngukurr have raised concerns about the potential threat to their health from shared use of surface waters inhabited by buffalo, in the South East Arnhem Land Indigenous Protected Area (SEAL IPA), Northern Australia. Surface waters are valued by local Indigenous people for spiritual and customary reasons, bush foods, medicines and drinking water. Here, we used molecular methods to characterise Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis assemblages from feral water buffalo living in the SEAL IPA to determine potential zoonotic risks to health of Indigenous people through co-use of surface water billabongs. Buffalo faecal DNA was screened for Cryptosporidium and Giardia using the 18S rRNA gene. Giardia were also screened using Glutamate hydrogenase (gdh) and beta eta-giardin (beta-giardin) genes. DNA sequencing identified C. ryanae in 9.9% (31/313) and G. duodenalis assemblage E 1.9% (6/313) in buffalo. Cryptosporidium ryanae is not considered zoonotic and G. duodenalis assemblage E is a livestock assemblage that has been reported in humans. Carriage of G. duodenalis assemblage E in buffalo may present a disease risk for Indigenous people utilising billabongs, according to customary practice.

TI Impact of the 2018 drought on pharmaceutical concentrations and general
   water quality of the Rhine and Meuse rivers
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Hydrological droughts are expected to increase in frequency and severity due to changing climate in several river basins. Recent severe droughts, like the 2018 drought in northwestern Europe, have shown major challenges for water management, not only in terms of water quantity, but also water quality. However, these water quality impacts have received far less attention, and limited understanding exists, in particular regarding concentration responses of emerging chemicals, such as pharmaceutical in surface waters under droughts. This study therefore shows the impacts of the 2018 drought on the water quality of the Rhine and Meuse rivers (Western Europe) focusing on a selection of water quality parameters relevant to multiple sectoral water uses and ecosystem health, i.e. water temperature, salinity and four pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, metoprolol, ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole). Surface water quality data of six monitoring stations (mainly in the Netherlands) were analyzed for the 2018 drought in comparison to the reference period 2014-2017. Our results show that low flow combined with high temperatures resulted in a general deterioration of surface water quality of both the Meuse and Rhine rivers during the 2018 drought. This was reflected by significant increases in water temperatures (average of +1.9 degrees C) and salinity levels (+11%). While we found higher concentrations of some pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine (+10%) and metoprolol (+29%)), these increases were statistically insignificant. The decline in water quality is primarily caused by limited dilution of the chemical load derived from point sources and salinity intrusion in the lower part of Rhine-Meuse delta. A comparison of the water quality responses of the Rhine and Meuse shows larger impacts for the rainfed Meuse river with lower summer flow, compared to the mixed rain-and snowmelt-fed Rhine river. Sustainable, transboundary river water management is essential to ensure water of suitable quality for different sectoral uses during future projected droughts.
